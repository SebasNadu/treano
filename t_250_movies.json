The genuinely impressive animation stands out from the other technical elements, especially considering that virtually every scene includes water.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by an adventurous epic score, characters receive efficient, thought-provoking arcs, conveying essential life lessons about understanding other perspectives and shamelessly accepting changes in our personal opinion, in addition to the evident premise of not judging a book by its cover.\r\n\r\nExcellent voice work by the entire cast, namely Zaris-Angel Hator. Monster action is immensely entertaining for all types of viewers.\r\n\r\nCouldn't recommend it more for a family watch.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+","created_at":"2022-07-17T18:43:47.633Z","id":"62d4586366f2d20067f74950","updated_at":"2022-07-17T18:43:47.633Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62d4586366f2d20067f74950"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1593604,"title":"The Sea Beast","original_title":"The Sea Beast","plot_overview":"The life of a legendary sea monster hunter is turned upside down when a young girl stows away on his ship.","type":"movie","runtime_minutes":119,"year":2022,"end_year":null,"release_date":"2022-06-24","imdb_id":"tt9288046","tmdb_id":560057,"tmdb_type":"movie","genres":[3,2,8,9],"genre_names":["Adventure","Animation","Family","Fantasy"],"user_rating":7.6,"critic_score":84,"us_rating":"PG","poster":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/posters/01593604_poster_w185.jpg","backdrop":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/backdrops/01593604_bd_w780.jpg","original_language":"en","similar_titles":[1389242,157045,1451009,1258009,1669092,1380851,1263404,1576276,1567407,1514676,1593596,1402266,1346024,150807,1171423,1438469,4147284,1669971,1633991,1169836,1299895,1399980,436709,473748,1418121],"networks":null,"network_names":[],"relevance_percentile":99.99,"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-E-IGQCsPo","trailer_thumbnail":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/video_thumbnails/657740_pthumbnail_320.jpg","sources":[{"source_id":203,"name":"Netflix","type":"sub","region":"US","ios_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","android_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","web_url":"http://www.netflix.com/title/81018682","format":"HD","price":null,"seasons":null,"episodes":null}]}],[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/5rrGVmRUuCKVbqUu41XIWTXJmNA.jpg","belongs_to_collection":{"id":1241,"name":"Harry Potter Collection","poster_path":"/eVPs2Y0LyvTLZn6AP5Z6O2rtiGB.jpg","backdrop_path":"/4gV0rKUjB1nLUdZB4zIltLvNZZr.jpg"},"budget":150000000,"genres":[{"id":12,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":14,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":10751,"name":"Family"}],"homepage":"https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/harry-potter-and-goblet-fire/","id":674,"imdb_id":"tt0330373","original_language":"en","original_title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","overview":"When Harry Potter's name emerges from the Goblet of Fire, he becomes a competitor in a grueling battle for glory among three wizarding schools—the Triwizard Tournament.

If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun!\r\n\r\nYear four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it's a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn't scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with! \r\n\r\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it's not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There's an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry's dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat. \r\n\r\nAs is customary for a Potter film, there's also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it's Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it's a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It's a series highlight that's not to be missed.\r\n\r\nA film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it's ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it's still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It's set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10","created_at":"2019-01-28T15:50:46.380Z","id":"5c4f24d60e0a264965d7f7b8","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:16.441Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5c4f24d60e0a264965d7f7b8"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1159476,"title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","original_title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","plot_overview":"When Harry Potter's name emerges from the Goblet of Fire, he becomes a competitor in a grueling battle for glory among three wizarding schools—the Triwizard Tournament.

While Harry also acquires a rather helpful book written by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.\r\n\r\nPotter 6 is not as dark as the pre-release chattings suggested it would be. Yes there's the usual dark moments, including a shattering turn of events that sets it up nicely for the finale, but this instalment is mostly fun, gentle and even sexy. Harry, Ron & Hermione are more under threat from their own adolescent urges than they are from the swirl of a Death Eater or the appearance of one young & creepy Tom Riddle. This of course makes for good viewing to most of us who have grown with the characters, with the principal young actors having nicely grown into said characters. But can it sustain a two and half hour running time? No it can't is the ass numbingly honest answer. There's some quality set-pieces including Quiddich (for a change) and a swamp attack by the Death Eaters, but by and large it's talky and breezy in equal measure.\r\n\r\nA filler Potter movie then, one that is far breezier than expected. Good but not great, but as a set up for the epic conclusion it hits all the right buttons. 6/10","created_at":"2019-08-20T23:42:47.482Z","id":"5d5c8577a3d02700150aeb17","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:25.574Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d5c8577a3d02700150aeb17"},{"author":"John Chard","author_details":{"name":"","username":"John Chard","avatar_path":"/utEXl2EDiXBK6f41wCLsvprvMg4.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"The seventh installment, the appetiser.\r\n\r\nAs the ultimate wizarding battle between good and evil draws ever closer, Harry, Hermione and Ron bunk off from Hogwarts to go search for the \"Horcruxes\" with which to halt the ever stronger Voldermort and his army, on the way they learn the importance of the Deathly Hallows artifacts.\r\n\r\nSo this is the one that sees the comfort confines of Hogwarts left behind as our intrepid trio of best pals hit the mountains and forests in search of the tools to stop old snake face in his tracks. In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it's not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn't have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he's a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.\r\n\r\nNew additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it's still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!\r\n\r\nTension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10","created_at":"2019-08-20T23:52:45.111Z","id":"5d5c87cdc4904800127cadff","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:25.578Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d5c87cdc4904800127cadff"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Has the quality direction of _Order of the Phoenix_ but manages to separate itself from that movie by having a script that isn't shit. \r\n\r\nFinal rating:★★★ - I liked it.

numerous attempts which saw talent attached only to depart before filming began, “Uncharted” has finally arrived on the big screen.\r\n\r\nThe movie is based on the hit Playstation series of games by Naughty Dog and stars Tom Holland as Nathan Drake, a young man who is as adept at history as he is with pickpocketing which he uses to offset his income from Bartending.\r\n\r\nNathan’s brother fled the law years earlier and aside from Postcards has had no contact with him over the years.  Things change when Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) arrives and recruits Nathan by showing him that he used to work with his brother. Despite misgivings and unresolved feelings; Nathan joins with Victor and finds himself in a daring caper to steal a valuable object that could unlock the key to a gold supply that has been lost for over five hundred years.\r\n\r\nNaturally, there are others who want the money, and Nathan, Victory, and their dubious partner Chloe (Sophia Ali); as they rush around the world in one adventure after another to solve the ancient puzzles and stay one step ahead of some very deadly individuals.\r\n\r\nThe movie has elements of “National Treasure” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in terms of the quests to find ancient treasures mixed with action but keeps things in a simpler context. The focus is not on plot development, character development, or plausibility but considering the film is based on a video game, it does a good job with the source material.\r\n\r\nThere has been some controversy about the casting of Holland as Nathan is older in the game series, but he goes all-in with his performance even when the acrobatic action sequences does offer many reminders of his Spider-man role.\r\n\r\nThe action in the game is fun and over-the-top and more than once I thought I should be pushing my X and Square button to help him make the moves necessary to complete the task and survive.\r\n\r\nThe post-credit scenes offer some great possibilities for future adventures and those would be more than welcome for those looking for some no-brainer escapist entertainment.\r\n\r\n3.5 stars out of 5.","created_at":"2022-02-16T15:20:52.890Z","id":"620d165467e0f70042a80db7","updated_at":"2022-02-16T15:20:52.890Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/620d165467e0f70042a80db7"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/uncharted-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Uncharted is an action-adventure flick, but despite a more entertaining last act, it fails to break the curse of videogame film adaptations due precisely to the lack of said action and adventure.\r\n\r\nEven though Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg offer good performances, as well as convincing arcs by the two protagonists, Ruben Fleischer delivers an extremely generic and formulaic narrative based on endless exposition. Additionally, the secondary characters become irrelevant due to the irritatingly repetitive betrayals and constant shifts of the true antagonist.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the general feeling is that it would be much more interesting to be controlling the characters than simply watching them.

I've never played the game this movie is adapted from but from what I hear it's pretty fun.  The movie itself is okay for a treasure hunting movie.  The action is good and keeps flowing, and the actors, Holland (latest Spiderman) and Whalberg seem to have good chemistry.  Even the female protagonist did well in her \"diverse & inclusive\" part.  \r\n\r\nIf I had any cons to put forth about the movie, I'd say the lead villian being a female (thanks to Woke-Hollywood's influence) has been thoroughly worn to the point of irritation.  This woke trope is tired and worse, but oh-so-true to the core, it is dubious at best; especially so when it comes to fight scenes between the protagonist and villain.  It is time for Hollywood to hang up its Woke-cape.  There is no need for \"inclusivity\" when you can just give someone the job because it works for the story instead of politics.  I wouldn't complain on this aspect so much if Liberal (woke) Hollywood had the ability to write good characters and therefore good scripts.  But that is not possible when you are reaching to tick off checkboxes.\r\n\r\n**Somewhat Spoiler & complaints:** If the movie had simply begun with a female villain and had her demostrate certain abilities in combat, then her fighting men would be more believable.  It also would establish WHY her people would follow her.  But the female antagonist's action scenes do not come across as pertinent as they should because her profession is not established in the movie.  I struggled to get a handle on whether she was a fellow treasure hunter since she knew Walberg's character personally and was there to advise the rich villain, or if she was a hired mecenary.  Turns out she was the later, but that still did not help  her character gel.  I kept thinking, \"Why on earth would anyone follow her?  She's hasn't done anything to prove she's more than any other run-of-the-mill killer.\"  If the movie failed in any way it was this one glaring aspect.  Henry Cavill made an EXCELLENT head henchman in Mission Impossible: Fallout, because men fighting men is believable; villains have menace.  But without that special training I mentioned for a female villian, any interaction between her and men in fight scenes comes across as purely contrived.  The actress, Tati Gabrielle, did very well as a villain but this women fighting men is just not believable; and that matters to the male viewing audience.  Instead of sitting on the edge of your chair wondering who's going to win, you're sitting back with a finger to your temple wondering what bullcrap Hollywood is going to make of this fight scene.  \r\n\r\nIf I have to rate this movie on a whole I give it 3.5/5 stars.  It's far removed from _National Treasure_ or _Indiana Jones_, but it's better than _Red Notice_, if only just.","created_at":"2022-04-30T21:58:34.791Z","id":"626db10a24b3330050fbfcf0","updated_at":"2022-09-24T05:00:11.852Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/626db10a24b3330050fbfcf0"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Good adventure-thriller in the vein of Tomb Raider.

It was a fun adventure/action rollercoaster plain and simple. This is one of those, rare nowadays, movies that are meant to entertain plain and simple. Two hours of adventure, action and twists barely held together by a rudimentary story and no woke rubbish or bullshit preaching. The latter is probably what rendered it a 40% rotten “critics” score on woke tomatoes while the audience gave it a 90% fresh score. As almost always a rotten score on woke tomatoes is an indication that it is a movie worthwhile watching.\r\n\r\nThe story, as can be seen from the movie blurb, is a treasure hunt a la Indiana Jones. It starts off by introducing the main character, Nathan, in a few brief scenes where Nathan bungles up a heist being perpetrated by his brother after which they are involuntarily separated.\r\n\r\nQuick forward to present time and the main story takes off with Nathan being persuaded by Sullivan to embark on a hunt for an immeasurable treasure. Not exactly the newest or freshest of stories but if it works don’t fix it.\r\n\r\nPretty much everyone in this movie is a self-centered scoundrel with little to no care for anyone except themselves. Thus the action and treasure hunting is regularly interrupted by twists and betrayals. No one will claim that this movie has an elaborate and intelligent story. It does not have to. It is just meant to hold the action together.\r\n\r\nI quite liked the main actors. Sullivan did a good job of being the blasé, self-centered scoundrel, Nathan of being the somewhat naive wannabe treasure hunter and Braddock was quite cool, and sexy (hey, I’m a guy), as the baddie. Antonio Banderas was Antonio Banderas although I was saddened by his premature exit from the hunt.\r\n\r\nOverall the action was nice although the scenes in, and out of, the airplane was the usual unrealistic Hollywood action. Although that was overshadowed with the ship carrying helicopter scenes towards the end which was taking unrealism to new levels. But I didn’t really care because it was fun silliness. The moment they started to carry those ships away I started to hope that the writer would go for the silly and obvious stunt involving black powder. Yes unrealistic but there is no denying the coolness factor.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned this was two hours well spent. The ending scene clearly suggested that the producers hoped to make a sequel. I would definitely watch it but with all the people lamenting the fact that someone dared to make a movie simply for entertainment without a profound (and boring) story or bullshit preaching in it that might not happen. It did make about four times its budget at the box office though so maybe.","created_at":"2022-09-10T07:33:30.672Z","id":"631c3dca0bb0760080232889","updated_at":"2022-09-10T07:37:19.614Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/631c3dca0bb0760080232889"},{"author":"[robbie grawey]","author_details":{"name":"[robbie grawey]","username":"robbiegrawey","avatar_path":"/qB7lELWBr2iNbKu3eYBI2bxzJ7I.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Fun, but flat!\r\n\r\nNeat adaptation of the games, the character of Nathan feels distinct enough that I wasn’t bothered by a lot of the world-building choices and changes.

I had a general idea of what to expect going into the film and got most of everything I wanted. While it is not groundbreaking cinema, it does offer so very great action set pieces that are pulled straight from the games I grew up loving. The story is very reminiscent of an adventure Nathan Drake would take during the games and the environments were diverse and engaging. My one big critique is the performances. While they were fine, I did not really think the casting was done in terms of the characters themselves but more for the star power. Tom Holland plays a character that is an edgier Peter Parker, he still has the charisma of Nathan Drake but there is something about him that still feels naïve and less sure of himself. I understand this is early in Nathan Drake's career, but it still felt to overly Spider-Man for me. There is really not much to say for Mark Wahlberg either, he plays pretty much the same character as every one of his other films. Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle, and Antonio Banderas all do a fine enough job in their roles but never do anything that make their performances stand out. Overall, this movie is fun if you sit back, relax and enjoy some great action and exploration. It is not great, but it definitely passes the time and is good time.\r\n\r\n**Score**: _68%_ | **Verdict:**

Seeking help from mechanic \"James\" (Brian Tyree Henry) she appears reluctant to give him her number. She claims she doesn't recall it... He is sceptical, but as the story now evolves we discover that this young woman is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan where she suffered an injury to her brain. With the help of him, and her physician \"Dr. Lucas\" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) she now tries to put some semblance of order - and fulfilment - back into her life. It is interesting, this film, insofar as it considers the perspective of a woman returning from conflict. Assumptions are made that would probably not be made about her male counterparts, and director Lila Neugebauer tries hard to ensure that how American society deals with these distinctions is writ large. Lawrence delivers quite well, she offers a nuanced effort that can be quite poignant at times, especially as we - and \"James\" get to know her character more, and as that character begins to emerge from her shell of shame, embarrassment and mistrust. It's not very well paced, though. Despite being only ninety minutes, I felt the points reiterated just once to often and the dialogue didn't really offer much succour to either the actors or the audience. We are left to assume too much; to project our own opinions and sympathies on her persona, and without ever possibly being able to empathise that left me feeling the drama was just a bit too sterile. As with many films depicting the struggle of returning soldiers to fit in and flourish at home, it has a profound message to send - but as a piece of cinema, there are too many lingering close ups, the score is really weak and unimaginative and it's nothing much to write home about.","created_at":"2022-11-19T05:18:40.479Z","id":"63786730c2f44b00c3551818","updated_at":"2022-11-19T05:20:56.706Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63786730c2f44b00c3551818"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1578564,"title":"Causeway","original_title":"Causeway","plot_overview":"A US soldier suffers a traumatic brain injury while fighting in Afghanistan and struggles to adjust to life back home in New Orleans.

the other day I was appalled at how the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre invokes a real-life tragedy such as a high school shooting to justify its brand of gratuitous violence. On the other side of the spectrum is a film like The Desperate Hour – a reminder that the most powerful stories about such tragic events don’t focus on violence but on people. The Desperate Hour (which never even makes it physically to the school) doesn’t reach the virtuoso heights of Gus Van Sant’s Elephant or Denis Villeneuve’s Polytechnique, and it fails to do so because it botches the third act, but remains nonetheless a poignant effort.\r\n\r\nNaomi Watts deserves quite a bit of credit for a performance that is as demanding physically as it is emotionally. She is in every single scene and her voice is almost exclusively the only one we don’t hear coming out of her cellphone; not only does she have to carry the entire movie all by herself, but she literally picks it up and runs with it. As the mother of a student attending a high school where there is an active shooter, this is inevitably somewhat of a one-note role, but sustaining that note without turning it up all the way to 11 is no mean feat; on the one hand her maternal instinct has to take over her every action and word, while on the other her growing concern must never give way to hysterics that will alienate the audience. Watts manages this delicate balance rather well, and her character is never anything other than relatable and accessible.\r\n\r\nAnd then comes the contrived third act, where the wheels come off in a way reminiscent to Halle Berry’s 2013 vehicle The Call. Of that movie Roger Moore of The Seattle Times wrote that “It's only when our Oscar-winning heroine puts down the phone and sets out to do some sleuthing of her own that The Call disconnects, turning into something far more generic and far less exciting”; here, Watts doesn’t put the phone down, but it’s who she calls that gives this otherwise fine film a spin that belongs more in a mindless thriller than in a thoughtful exploration of this subject.","created_at":"2022-08-28T05:34:05.395Z","id":"630afe4ddcb6a30080078cc0","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:32:04.927Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630afe4ddcb6a30080078cc0"},{"author":"Dean","author_details":{"name":"Dean","username":"Ditendra","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4172cb0f573872484d9c3a4aa13ce65c.jpg","rating":2.0},"content":"I was hoping that it would be another great movie playing Naomi Watts as I love most movies she's in, but sadly this one isn't one of them.

I cannot say that I I had high hopes for this movie but I have watched the other movies in the franchise and I am a bit of a sucker for horror/fantasy/science fiction movies. Especially if one can expect a decent amount of special effects and gore so…\r\n\r\nIt is not a great movie. Not even a good movie really but it is a half decent B-movie horror flick. It sure as hell is better than that woke piece of trash that Netflix has produced with their TV-show adaptation of the franchise but then that does not really say very much.\r\n\r\nThe story is rather non-existent and things just happen for no good reason. It is like the writer just took a bunch of zombie and monster encounters and threw them in a mixer to see what came out. Sure there is a resemblance of a background story there but it is not much.\r\n\r\nWe never get to know why the zombies escaped into Raccoon City, why the experiments where abandoned or anything else that might enlighten us as to why zombies pop up here and there all the time (apart from the fact that it is a Resident Evil movie and it is Raccoon City of course). There also seems to be a number of characters in the movie that knows a lot about what is actually going on but again, we never really get much of an explanation. I have understood that the movie is based on the story in the first three of the games so I guess those that have played them might understand the why’s better.\r\n\r\nThe main reason to watch this movie is the special effects, the gore and the action and this is best done with your brain in the off position. There are indeed some decent gory special effects and I have to say that the monsters in the later half of the movie was pretty okay.\r\n\r\nI do miss Milla Jovovich though. There is not really any good kick-ass replacement for her although some of the characters tried. Also, for f… sake, will the dumbass Hollywood script writers ever going to stop putting stupid shit in the movies, like firing off bazookas and rocket launcher in confined spaces, say a train car. It doesn’t work unless the goal is to also kill the person firing it you morons!\r\n\r\nOne thing that annoyed me throughout the entire movie though is the fact that it is really dark. Sure it is a horror movie so some dark scenes is to be expected but the entire movie is really really dark. To the extent that it really is difficult to see what is going on for a lot of the movie. It might have worked in a cinema but on a TV-screen, even with the pretty good OLED that I have, it is really too dark.\r\n\r\nSo it was pretty much what I expected, a basic B-movie of the gore feast variety. Didn’t feel like I wasted my time but that is a positive as it gets.","created_at":"2022-07-16T16:56:26.003Z","id":"62d2edb953f83304009f59dc","updated_at":"2022-07-16T16:56:26.003Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62d2edb953f83304009f59dc"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"**The director’s love for the games is apparent, but too many poor decisions ruined what could have been the best and most faithful Resident Evil yet.**\r\n\r\nWelcome to Raccoon City marks the first live-action Resident Evil adaptation to stick close to the original games in story and feel. Character costumes looked like they were plucked right from the games. Sets and locations were identical to levels I spent hours playing. Easter eggs and nods throughout the film celebrated hardcore fans. Unfortunately, its flaws overshadow its victories. An overcrowded story with too many characters prevented developing the characters or making the story have any real impact. Forcing two full game stories into an hour and 47-minute run time had consequences. I enjoyed the movie’s attention to the slow descent from human to zombie, which showed the dread and hopelessness as the victims felt their humanity drain away. There is also a fantastic action scene in complete darkness where the muzzle flash provides the only light for the survivors to see. There were some wonderful moments that Resident Evil fans will enjoy, but nostalgia is really the only thing Welcome to Raccoon City has going for it.","created_at":"2022-08-27T18:17:33.776Z","id":"630a5fbdb042280082eb2171","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:29:58.844Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630a5fbdb042280082eb2171"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}},{"id":1513886,"title":"Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City","original_title":"Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City","plot_overview":"Once the booming home of pharmaceutical giant Umbrella Corporation, Raccoon City is now a dying Midwestern town.

time a London family struggle in their haunted house.**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I am not a big fan of the first film, but I liked that. Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.\r\n\r\nA family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.\r\n\r\nThe one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clichés were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_","created_at":"2016-10-04T20:18:31.673Z","id":"57f40e9792514138f0000304","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:51.519Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/57f40e9792514138f0000304"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"I know I'm in the minority on this, but I actually preferred it to the original.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go._","created_at":"2017-02-06T06:15:07.387Z","id":"5898146bc3a3687709004d82","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:53.261Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5898146bc3a3687709004d82"},{"author":"Sheldon Nylander","author_details":{"name":"Sheldon Nylander","username":"dalboz","avatar_path":"/d9fi8H0uBIhn9B9WY8Avo5L1vzm.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"I'm giving this half a star more than I gave the first movie. As a horror film in its own rite, it's competently made, although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes. But it is better than the first one in that it's a more cohesive film, with such corrections as how the background \"monster\" actually does play a part in the story, whereas in the first film Annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distraction.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the reason I can't rate this film higher is because it's about the Warrens, who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people. While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story. Take it with a massive grain of salt.","created_at":"2019-08-25T11:21:15.195Z","id":"5d626f2bbc8abc176c24efc2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:25.910Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d626f2bbc8abc176c24efc2"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Really solid sequel, and a re-watch before seeing the third film, in fact probably liked this one slightly better, with some good scares but better, a nice heart at the center with the relationship between Ed and Lorraine, played wonderfully by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga.

Enter the new governor \"Foxington\" who basically ridicules them, declaims their achievement and provokes them into pulling the ultimate crime - the theft of the golden dolphin. What now ensues is an \"Ocean's 5\" style logistics exercise as the five of them carefully plan the theft. The trophy is to be presented to the icon of decency \"Professor Marmalade\" but is he quite who he seems? Is the governor? These films are a bit ten-a-penny, and this one isn't really very special. The dialogue is entertainingly quick-fire now and again (especially the snake and the piranha); \"Weaps\" - the extra nimble taratunla provides the gadgetry and the animation is efficient with plenty of action once the film gets moving. The ending, though, is daft and hurried and who knew there were so many millions of guinea pigs in the world!?

It's funny, the action scenes are very well done, the characters are charming, the dialogues are excellent and the animation style, in a mix of 2D and 3D, is the icing on the cake to complete an (almost) perfect animation.\r\n\r\n'Almost' because the plot was pretty average. It's interesting and even brings a nice message, but I think it lacked a little more development, especially in making the movie more unpredictable. Halfway through the movie you already knew who the villain was and how the movie was going to end. They even added multiple 'twists' to make the story more unpredictable, but almost all of them were far-fetched and failed to surprise me.\r\n\r\nDespite that, this movie was a breath of originality from Dreamworks after a decade of bland animations. I'll give it a solid 8.","created_at":"2022-04-15T15:47:15.557Z","id":"6259938374d6c01b71085168","updated_at":"2022-04-19T22:27:02.533Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6259938374d6c01b71085168"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"It’s a shame that the story isn’t nearly as appealing as the animation in _The Bad Guys_.

With a clear distinction between being \"good\" and \"bad\", stereotypes and preconceived notions are brilliantly addressed in a sweet redemption story that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe voice cast is exceptional, elevating an admittedly formulaic narrative in a remarkably impactful manner. Despite being more geared towards children, the entertainment levels are high enough for any generation. The blend of 2D and 3D animation works flawlessly, offering an overall distinct look compared to what audiences are used to.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's yet another recommendation for families.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2022-07-24T00:06:17.800Z","id":"62dc8cf9dc1cb4004fab83e5","updated_at":"2022-07-24T00:06:17.902Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62dc8cf9dc1cb4004fab83e5"},{"author":"[robbie grawey]","author_details":{"name":"[robbie grawey]","username":"robbiegrawey","avatar_path":"/qB7lELWBr2iNbKu3eYBI2bxzJ7I.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Visually great and stylistically cool!

A group of folks rent a house on the farm of an elderly couple. They arrive and settle down to make their porn film. Director \"RJ\" (Owen Campbell) isn't happy when his girlfriend \"Lorraine\" (Jenna Ortega) wants to join in and determines to skedaddle in the middle of the night. Suffice to say, he doesn't quite manage and next thing the whole load of them are in peril of their lives. This contains one of the daftest old age sex scenes I have ever seen, but that is all I found even vaguely memorable about this rather derivative film. Sure, it's got an hungry alligator but the ending is weak, and the characters just parodied everything crass from the tacky late 1970s adult entertainment industry in a really flat, sterile, fashion. Takes too long to get going, and certainly does not need to be seen on a big screen.

What a refreshing entry into the modern-day horror genre. So many movies are either plagued with remakes or supernatural elements, it is so nice to see a back to bones hack and slash. This movie does way more than that though, deep down there is a very heart touching story about growing old and becoming irrelevant. It is so interesting to be so emotionally connected to the killer but yet disturbed by the actions they take as well. I just cannot get over how good this movie is! The gore, the setup, the dialogue, the plot, everything about it I dug.

epic Marvel Saga that started over ten years ago has been building up to the inevitable clash with the powerful tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin).  Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; “Avengers: End Game” and at long last it has arrived.\r\n\r\nPicking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. \r\n\r\nAs time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible.\r\n\r\nInspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right.\r\n\r\nThe film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments.\r\n\r\nThis all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\r\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed.\r\n\r\nIt is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way.\r\n\r\nAs this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; “Avengers: End Game” is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5","created_at":"2019-04-23T22:40:39.757Z","id":"5cbf94670e0a266b96fba5ef","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:20.522Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5cbf94670e0a266b96fba5ef"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"Hey, so, just some really quick thoughts I wanna get down, 'cause it's after 1 o'clock in the morning, and I wanna get some sleep so I can wake up well rested to see _Endgame_ again.\r\n\r\nPutting it out there right from the get-go, _Avengers: Endgame_ is my favourite MCU movie. It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing.\r\n\r\nI will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, then _Endgame_ is not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It's the end of _Infinity War_ but also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters.\r\n\r\nTo me though? My first 9 out of 10 rating in **three years**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._","created_at":"2019-04-24T15:24:16.492Z","id":"5cc07fa00e0a2615fdf464d3","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:20.545Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5cc07fa00e0a2615fdf464d3"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nDon't worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it's such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I'm extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I'm obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue). \r\n\r\nHowever, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don't think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It's epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It's pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don't expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that's going to make you pretty much either \"love\" or \"like\" this movie. I absolutely love it! \r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can't deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don't have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there.\r\n\r\nSome people didn't really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn't work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. \r\n\r\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won't know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who've lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves.\r\n\r\nThe humor is mostly on-point, but it's still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act's tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn't expect such an “easygoing” and “funny” vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue.\r\n\r\nVisually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can't wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It's just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I'm listening to it right now as I'm writing this review, and I'm getting chills all over my body. \r\n\r\nI can't really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson's, Evans', and Robert Downey Jr's (Tony Stark / Iron Man). “New” characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don't judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors' minds in the first place!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don't know what to do now. The only thing I'm sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn't fall asleep properly because I couldn't stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It's everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It's that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can't even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we'll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame!\r\n\r\nPS: it's not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn't exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn't everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+. I don’t need to wait for that second viewing with Endgame … And thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. No yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. Thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life!\r\n\r\nRating: A+","created_at":"2019-04-26T13:29:35.406Z","id":"5cc307bfc3a36809ab86e2fd","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:20.634Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5cc307bfc3a36809ab86e2fd"},{"author":"heroman","author_details":{"name":"","username":"heroman","avatar_path":"/2WwZgycMoaeJZMxIM2scCaNPUFu.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"okay so if your like me you questioned this movie due to the fact that i personally thought nothing could beat infinity war well after seeing it i can honestly say we have a new champion this was absolutley excelent so hilarious action packed the 3 hrs passes extremily fast my only thing is the use of god.... bothered me and i suggest if your offended by that wait till dvd so you can mute the parts also a reminder to parents 'no matter how bad you want to see the movie dont do like people in my theater did and bring your 3 year old 'but besides that awesome movie","created_at":"2019-04-28T14:07:45.890Z","id":"5cc5b3b1c3a36849368181c9","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:20.684Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5cc5b3b1c3a36849368181c9"},{"author":"courtlynn","author_details":{"name":"","username":"courtlynn","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60d7505b20eec00168a17b0cf1728573.jpg","rating":null},"content":"We waited till day 5 of release in theaters.

For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.\r\n\r\nI have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.\r\n\r\nIt was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI was not too thrilled about the “new” Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill’s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character.\r\n\r\nI was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed.\r\n\r\nThere were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.\r\n\r\nThere were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie.

All I’ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of \"Back to the Future II\" (1989).\r\n\r\n“Endgame” (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.\r\n\r\nEverything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff’s edge, and much more. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can’t concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie’s overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-","created_at":"2019-07-05T20:24:06.417Z","id":"5d1fb1e694d8a849843eb1e2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:23.947Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d1fb1e694d8a849843eb1e2"},{"author":"Justin Lopez","author_details":{"name":"Justin Lopez","username":"ShawnSmith","avatar_path":"/5zwo9rNpYTQxPFxXJeYHxEw86SC.jpg","rating":null},"content":"The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren’t enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers.

The process and ending is clear about 10% into the movie. Zero development of character. Amateur plot twist. All cliche and low class humor. It is 21st century and they still cling on adult fairy tale and plain visual stimulation. The whole purpose is to let fans know what happens to the character. Good business investment but great shame to the art of movie industry. It is a blatant exploitation of grandpa IP with zero innovation. \r\n\r\nHero fantasy lived in half a century ago.

you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\n2020 is unquestionably one of the most challenging years movie theaters ever had to face. The still going global pandemic closed down everything, including my favorite place to spend the most wonderful time. Therefore, the already growing streaming services got a huge bump, earning more and more subscribers during this tough phase in our lives. Netflix has been extremely busy releasing brand-new flicks since the beginning of the year, being The Devil All The Time, I’m Thinking of Ending Things, and Project Power the latest. Some better than others, but I’m still to find a 2020’s original film from the studio that I genuinely dislike. Is Enola Holmes the first one?\r\n\r\nWell, no, far from that. With such a talented cast and high production value, a new take on the classic Sherlock Holmes’ mysteries is certainly welcome, and this is one of my top two compliments. Debutant director Harry Bradbeer and Jack Thorne (His Dark Materials) offer a refreshing twist on the famous detective’s stories, not only by focusing on her less popular sister instead but also by delivering a different Sherlock than the one we’re used to seeing. The editing (Adam Bosman), cinematography (Giles Nuttgens), and score (Daniel Pemberton) contribute to quirky, fun, captivating scenes that help the viewer follow Enola’s assessment of several situations, including her thought process (interpretation of clues, formulating plans), most of the times by breaking the fourth wall.\r\n\r\nThis last aspect takes me to my other top two praise, Millie Bobby Brown. She’s the reason why these sequences work so well. From the moment I first saw her in Stranger Things, I genuinely believed she would be a star. For the past few years, I’ve constantly left in writing that she will break the Oscars’ record for the youngest actress to ever win a Best Actress award. Millie still has a bit more than five years to achieve that, and she’s already leading major blockbusters like Godzilla: King of the Monsters. With this Netflix movie, Millie proves once again her versatility (already portrayed completely different characters in distinct genres), emotional range (effortlessly delivers any type of scene), and mature acting (rarely overacts or doesn’t offer enough, she’s always on point).\r\n\r\nShe incorporates Enola in such a unique manner that I struggle to find a better choice to play this character, who is herself also a standout. Enola’s arc feels genuinely empowering. It doesn’t feel like a forced political statement nor a narratively illogical decision to develop this character in the way Thorne does. Every enigma she tries to decipher, every plan she needs to create to save someone or something, every choice she makes feels earned and justified. Enola doesn’t let herself be restricted by old society’s rules of how the world should work. She wants to be herself without having to answer to nobody. It might be a generic message, but it’s transmitted through seamless execution.\r\n\r\nRegarding the rest of the cast, Henry Cavill is a major surprise as Sherlock, and I won’t be shocked if it generates some controversy (update: it did). It’s a notably different version of the distant, emotionless, overly analytical Sherlock that Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch interpreted, which I embrace with open arms. I don’t care about rights or origins. A character is what the actor and writer(s) make of it, it doesn’t belong to anyone let alone its “fans”. Cavill shows a cheekier display than what he’s used to presenting, and Thorne adjusted a couple of specific traits from the classic character. Louis Partridge and Sam Claflin are both excellent as Lord Viscount Tewksbury and Mycroft, respectively. The remaining actors all offer decent performances, but the two standouts are undoubtedly Millie and Cavill.\r\n\r\nAs for the film itself, I was ready to write “it’s fine” half an hour before I finished it. Even though it feels unique in several areas, Enola Holmes still follows a pretty generic story, with formulaic plot points and the usual character drama. Sadly, it doesn’t really bring anything new story-wise. It features no surprises, which is not a good attribute for a movie with a central mystery. However, that lack of enthusiasm leads me to a significant issue I didn’t expect to find in the latter half of the film. Its mystery isn’t truly one, and it’s set aside midway through the movie, which is a questionable narrative decision. I don’t remember the last time (if ever) where a film completely discards its main storyline (one that received an entire first act of set up), replacing it with a young-adult romantic endeavor (which is pretty convincing, but not as a main storyline).\r\n\r\nI’m a firm advocate of the trailer-free methodology. Expectations can make or break the viewer’s opinion about a movie, and nowadays, trailers can be deceiving, misleading, and show way too much. I missed everything related to this film, watching it 100% blind. Had I watched Enola Holmes’ official trailer beforehand, I’d definitely be inclined to the negative side of the divisive line I stand on right now. Its trailer focuses on what most people will expect from the movie: the main mystery surrounding Enola’s mother disappearance. Considering how the film actually goes, it’s safe to write that its trailer is a bit deceiving.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Enola Holmes offers a pleasant, refreshing take on a franchise that might have a new future now. Focusing on Sherlock Holmes’ sister, Harry Bradbeer and Jack Thorne deliver a light, fun, entertaining story, packed with action, clues to decipher, and a brilliant cast. Millie Bobby Brown keeps climbing up the stairs of success, demonstrating her versatility, range, and maturity as a young actress. It’s a matter of time until she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in Hollywood. Her chemistry with Henry Cavill and Louis Partridge is phenomenal, and her fourth wall breaks are fascinating. Technically, Enola’s thoughts and feelings are perfectly transmitted to the audience through outstanding editing, cinematography, and score. However, story-wise, it’s as generic as it could be, boasting absolutely no surprises, and a central mystery that’s not quite one. It’s still a fine Saturday night flick to enjoy with family and friends but be advised: its trailer is a tad misleading, so keep your mind open and expectations grounded.\r\n\r\nRating: B-","created_at":"2020-09-22T11:49:36.751Z","id":"5f69e4d0cee2f6003633becf","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:44.958Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f69e4d0cee2f6003633becf"},{"author":"Kamurai","author_details":{"name":"Kamurai","username":"Kamurai","avatar_path":"/sKeC7qZLAKreuwxH4x6U3mN7Aa8.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Really good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nTo absolutely fair, I'm not sure if this will appeal to Sherlock Holmes fans, but does expand the \"Sherlock-verse\", so make up your own mind.\r\n\r\nI love Millie Bobby Brown (\"Stranger Things\"), and this proves she is quite capable of not only leading a movie, but carrying the entire bloody thing.\r\n\r\nDespite what feels almost a lack of contribution from everyone else in the movie, this actually turns out quite good.  I do wish she didn't do the fourth wall breaks, it really feels like she's either turning to a documentary crew or suddenly updating instagram.  It was a little jarring, and they're clearly referencing Sherlock's \"mind palace\" techniques displayed in the movies, but with a \"twist\".\r\n\r\nI honestly expected someone to ask her if she's okay, like in \"Dora and the Lost City of Gold\".  It would have been equally acceptable to do narration over her actions in the same, but I understand wanting to do something different.\r\n\r\nThe only other people that didn't seem to be phoning it in were Burn Gorman who did quite a good antagonist, and Frances de la Tour who managed to elevate \"concerned grannie\".\r\n\r\nMaybe Sam Claflin did the job perfectly and Mycroft is supposed to be that bland and irritating, but Henry Cavill had an air of being relieved that didn't have to have Sherlock doing any real deductions, he just had to stand there and seem mildly intrigued by things.\r\n\r\nOverall, there is a good movie here in spite of itself, and the sad part is that it could have been great.","created_at":"2020-09-26T19:57:26.402Z","id":"5f6f9d26a6e2d2003a7d4e02","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:45.210Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f6f9d26a6e2d2003a7d4e02"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Not sure I'd like this as much if it was without Millie Bobby Brown, who is excellent.\r\n\r\n<em>'Enola Holmes'</em> is a good film, even if it does hold issues. The plot isn't one that entertained me that much, the mystery elements are average, though it still has a few moments. The humour is solid, as it just about everything else. I didn't love the constant \"fourth wall breaking\", but Brown helps make it work to the point it didn't get annoying.\r\n\r\nLouis Partridge impresses too. Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin are strong casts to play Sherlock and Mycroft. I liked seeing Burn Gorman and Adeel Akhtar in their respective roles. The cast, as a whole, are enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised to see this get multiple sequels, I actually reckon it could turn into a good if unspectacular series - as long as Brown sticks around.","created_at":"2021-01-04T03:30:43.069Z","id":"5ff28be3df294500412d96d4","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:49.660Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5ff28be3df294500412d96d4"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1564077,"title":"Enola Holmes","original_title":"Enola Holmes","plot_overview":"While searching for her missing mother, intrepid teen Enola Holmes uses her sleuthing skills to outsmart big brother Sherlock and help a runaway lord.","type":"movie","runtime_minutes":123,"year":2020,"end_year":null,"release_date":"2020-09-23","imdb_id":"tt7846844","tmdb_id":497582,"tmdb_type":"movie","genres":[1,2,13,4,5],"genre_names":["Action","Adventure","Comedy","Crime","Mystery"],"user_rating":7,"critic_score":80,"us_rating":"PG-13","poster":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/posters/01564077_poster_w185.jpg","backdrop":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/backdrops/01564077_bd_w780.jpg","original_language":"en","similar_titles":[1628240,1570233,1129885,1351085,148119,1158122,1410850,1406149,1679851,1135872,1500490,167043,1261168,1352687,11644,144361,164925,1282745,130817,1142273,1176135,1147274,1123147,154344,1232713],"networks":null,"network_names":[],"relevance_percentile":99.89,"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d0Zf9sXlHk","trailer_thumbnail":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/video_thumbnails/719060_pthumbnail_320.jpg","sources":[{"source_id":203,"name":"Netflix","type":"sub","region":"US","ios_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","android_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","web_url":"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81277950","format":"HD","price":null,"seasons":null,"episodes":null}]}],[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/9gDzYmuy4Gait4GgeGiKdh68XvF.jpg","belongs_to_collection":{"id":10455,"name":"Child's Play Collection","poster_path":"/fLWDbZziq47lcN28Q1ILnIMLHEC.jpg","backdrop_path":"/aWLxBxRtQP5a6oKkXqGkGYEPmNX.jpg"},"budget":25000000,"genres":[{"id":35,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":27,"name":"Horror"},{"id":53,"name":"Thriller"}],"homepage":"","id":11932,"imdb_id":"tt0144120","original_language":"en","original_title":"Bride of Chucky","overview":"Chucky hooks up with another murderous doll, the bridal gown-clad Tiffany, for a Route 66 murder spree with their unwitting hosts.","popularity":168.647,"poster_path":"/mAGviFp1ufYM3EaZBSrjPiKPBt6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Midwinter Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-10-16","revenue":50671850,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Chucky gets lucky.","title":"Bride of Chucky","video":false,"vote_average":5.974,"vote_count":1532,"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bride of Chucky Trailer","key":"gtDElSGxU8s","published_at":"2007-01-28T18:42:56.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec671c3a3685448002142"}]},"reviews":{"page":1,"results":[{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"_Bride of Chucky_ was the true turning point for the franchise, and though they hadn't 100% embraced comedy at this point like they did in the followup, there's still at least as much humour and reference in this one as there is elements of \"horror\".

A crucial disclaimer: you'll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches. Some people will review it as a standalone, regular movie, while others will look at it as an extended/alternate cut of a film previously released. I'm part of the latter group of reviewers.\r\n\r\nI find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything Snyder had in his hand. Director/Extended/Ultimate Cut, call it what you feel it's appropriate, but it's a four-hour movie, so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant. The narrative is fundamentally the same, which means the audience knows what's coming from a general perspective. Still, I'm reviewing this version mostly on its own merits, but without forgetting that it's not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released.\r\n\r\nWithout getting into spoilers, I do have to write this: the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading, and I don't doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters. The whole \"it's a totally distinct movie\" or \"Joss Whedon only used 10% of Snyder's footage\" were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didn't need it. Out of the 119 minutes of the 2017's version, probably around 80/90 minutes are also in the Snyder Cut, which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique. The base of the narrative is identical, most scenes are just extended versions of the original, but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make Zack Snyder's Justice League better than its \"predecessor\".\r\n\r\nThe most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about Cyborg. Ray Fisher's character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie. From his backstory to the development across the runtime, Cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut, leaving as a complete, compelling character who I genuinely cared for. On the other hand, Aquaman and The Flash receive similar introductory scenes with Batman, barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences. However, once the League is assembled, the character interactions increase, improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the \"Us United\" storyline.\r\n\r\nThe humor and tone remain lighter than in other Snyder films, clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version (Whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut). The intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing, but the longer build-ups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent. Compared to the original's abrupt, awful editing work, the Snyder Cut has a tremendously better flow, giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other. I rather watch an overlong film with a well-built story than the complete contrary. Some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movie's consistency.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, besides the fantastic arc given to Cyborg, there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline, but when it comes to the main narrative, it's more or less about the same. Every action sequence with pre-existent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before, but the new VFX are as hit-and-miss as Junkie XL's score. The latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing. While some scenes get an absolutely perfect, epic soundtrack, others receive weird, out-of-place music distracting the scene itself.\r\n\r\nThere's only one change I definitely dislike: the R rating brings horribly artificial, forced blood splashes and out-of-nowhere cursing that simply don't belong in the film. I know Snyder loves his gritty, bloody, gory action - as do I - but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action, or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film. A few bloody sequences work well enough, but most just feel notably forced, while the cursing feels ridiculously out-of-character at points. It's by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut, but admittedly, one that doesn't heavily impact my opinion.\r\n\r\nA common issue I have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove. Snyder Cut partially breaks that rule, removing some scenes from the 2017's version, supposedly only Whedon's footage (which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie). While most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient, there's a couple of them that not only don't improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film. For example, in Snyder Cut, the \"bringing Superman back\" arc lacks an important character's take on the situation, having in mind that character's past. It actually feels a bit out-of-character that the viewers don't get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action.\r\n\r\nRegarding Steppenwolf, his design looks better than the terrible original, and his motivations are clearer, but unfortunately, he remains a generic CGI punching bag for our superheroes. His dynamic armor is packed with spikes, but it's really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle. I can't get into spoilers about Darkseid or DeSaad, but I can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fan-service, just like Joker (Jared Leto). The ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new/extended action scenes, and it does play out differently - though the conclusion is essentially the same - leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon.\r\n\r\nZack Snyder's Justice League is arguably a more cohesive, consistent, and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017's version. As expected, its four-hour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary, irrelevant scenes, but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly non-theatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose. Despite most of the original Justice League being present in the Snyder Cut - something that might surprise a few fans - the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition. Cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio did. The extended action sequences are more riveting, and pre-existent footage is definitely improved, but the new VFX are as erratic as Junkie XL's all-over-the-place score. The R-rating is the only straight-up negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced, fake-looking blood and rare yet cringe-worthy cursing. Highly anticipated characters and/or storylines are better described as unimpactful fan-service, but overall, most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built. In the end, I sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled, and I hope that the DCEU continues with Snyder involved - just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions.\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2021-03-15T16:20:41.130Z","id":"604f89596517d6006a209fa0","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:53.219Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/604f89596517d6006a209fa0"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Definitely an improvement over the Whedon version and as a DC fan, enjoyed plenty of the character moments (and the addition of MM) but the story did feel off even though the film is nearly four hours long, in addition the alternate timeline part at the end felt tacked on and unnecessary.

FU WB for not giving Snyder the time to finish this as he envisioned.  THIS is what we should have gotten, not the tripe that was Josstice League.  This movie shows that Snyder was not just trying to catch up to Marvel, he was their own version of their stories and it should have been allowed to come to the end of the cycle.  \r\nAlso, I was underwhelmed by the score and would have loved Zimmer to have returned to complete this.  \r\nAnd there are a couple of initial set-up scenes that could have been let go or shortened and the gapping continuity error scene in the middle where the JL get introduced to Alfred after theyve already met him should have just been left out. \r\n\r\nBut we got what we asked for - the Snyder Cut in its entirety. \r\nAnd I am grateful for that...thankyou.\r\n\r\nNow, could we please create ZSJL2 so we can see the Injustice and Darkseid stories.","created_at":"2021-03-20T05:20:43.261Z","id":"6055862bfd4f800074b8e18f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:53.468Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6055862bfd4f800074b8e18f"},{"author":"Peter89Spencer","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Peter89Spencer","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dadb1b759a8516c815cdcc58abcefc85.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"I really, really REALLY wasn't expecting this - it felt like the extended edition of Lord of the Rings, if Zack Snyder directed it!\r\nNo, this was Zack Snyder's vision of Justice which we should've seen, if it wasn't for Joss Whedon hadn't pissed all over it. I mean, I understand why Snyder had to pull out the production, I really do, but Whedon could've had the decency to keep to heart on Snyder's work. Looking back, it was a total disrespect to the visionary director. This film...wow! It was truly and 100% amazed me.\r\n\r\nPlus, my best highlight was the voiceover of of Superman's dads Johnathan and Jor-El reminding him of who is he - it felt poignant.\r\n\r\nThat said, a couple of things I feel I must complain about this, just small things; 1) I noticed Mera had a change of accent. Probably an original idea, but it sounded funny especially soon after 2018 Aquaman was released. 2) Victor Stone's dad Silas sacrificed himself - not only was it upsetting but it changes everything for the future of DCEU films. I guess this means they;ll have to rewrite everything for that Cyborg movie!\r\n\r\nAt least we got the introduction of the Joker (Jared Leto reprising his role) as well as the (not so) surprising twist of the Martian Manhunter!\r\nNot to mention we finally got to see the appearance of Darkseid - it was all like a fusion of 300's Persian empire and LOTR's Sauron!\r\n\r\nIn the end, this was a true masterpiece from Zack Snyder, since Watchmen and Sucker Punch, and I am so pleased - no, grateful this was made.

And what we're left with?\r\n\r\nDarkseid gets his ass kicked and then forgets he was ever on Earth. Hardly anything spectacular.\r\n\r\nSteppenwolf's armor now looks like something designed by early 90s Rob Liefeld, which is not at all a compliment.\r\n\r\nThe Cyborg stuff was pretty good for the most part, although the sequence with the single mother was just as pointless as Whedon's Russian family and there was absolutely no logical reason why his father had to sacrifice himself. But Snyder is a fan of fathers sacrificing themselves when there is absolutely no logical reason for it (see Jonathan Kent in Man of Steel).\r\n\r\nSo what else is there?\r\n\r\n\"Superman wears the black suit!\"\r\n\r\nOkay...and...? It's just a black version of his usual suit, there's no story reason why he wears it, and it looks like Snyder intended for him to keep on wearing it. Which is stupid and doesn't fit that character at all. And amusingly enough, I see some of the people freaking out about this who in the 90s would have lost their shit if Tim Burton's black-suited Superman movie ever got made.\r\n\r\nWe also have Wonder Woman splattering bad guy brains over walls and vaporizing people RIGHT IN FRONT OF LITTLE KIDS! And once Steppenwolf is clearly defeated, Superman heat visions off part of his head FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON OTHER THAN CRUELTY! \r\n\r\nThis is what people are all pumped up for? To see Superman and Wonder Woman go all Abu Ghraib on people?\r\n\r\nOh, and we get the Martian Manhunter.

But does he turn up at the Batcave to say, \"You could probably use my help\"? No, he just hangs back, impersonates Martha Kent, and then only shows up to offer his help AFTER THE THREAT HAS BEEN DEFEATED! Gee, J'onn, maybe we could have used you back when Steppenwolf WAS FLAT-OUT MURDERING PEOPLE! This movie takes one of the greatest Justice Leaguers of all, a character who has always been a model of selflessness, and turns him into a coward who sits on the sidelines.\r\n\r\nAnd then of course we get the Knightmare sequence, where we get to be subjected once more to Jared Leto's absolutely godawful Joker performance, Batman drops an F-bomb because idiot fanboys with the emotional maturity of a 12-year-old think that's \"badass,\" and Snyder basically riles up his little cult so they can start harassing people about #RestoreTheSnyderverse.\r\n\r\nThis whole endeavor was nothing other than a reward for the absolute worst and most toxic elements of fandom.

However, I’m fairly well versed in them and the Justice League is my favorite DC team. When it was announced that DC would come out with a Justice League movie after the Avengers, I had hope...that is until I learned that they’d be doing a team movie first and individual movies afterward. This is the exact opposite of what Marvel did.\r\n\r\nDuring the production of the first movie, Zack Snyder had the incredibly unfortunate disposition of learning that his daughter had committed suicide. Understandably, he took a break from the movie. Because Warner executives don’t understand anything, they went on with the production.\r\n\r\nHiring Joss Whedon to finish the production, the final product was lackluster at best. In typical Zack Snyder style, it was more flash than substance. After it came out, Zack went public and said that the movie was nowhere near his final vision. Not long after this, the hashtag #releasethesnydercut was trending on Twitter. Four years later, the director’s cut was completed and we got a monstrosity of a movie. Now the true question is “Was this movie worth the hype?”\r\n\r\nHonestly...not really.\r\n\r\nNow I write this from the point of view of one who’s been a comic book fan for 32 years. Also realize that there are MANY stories that I haven’t read and equally as many storylines that I’m ignorant to. However, I understand the characters. I’m a firm believer that character develops story. George Lucas said: “A Special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.” This is a lesson that Zack Snyder has never learned. Now, Joss Whedon gave us an amazing movie with The Avengers - and that’s the only comparison that I’ll make - so it’s possible that WB wanted some of that lightning in a bottle for JL and that’s why they brought him on.\r\n\r\nWhen Ray Fisher went public and said that Joss created a hostile work environment (as well as one of the producers), the way it was presented was that he didn’t get things that he wanted, so he’d complain. I’m glad to admit that I was wrong in that assumption. Ray actually opened the floodgates against Joss and it turns out that he’s not a good person - he’s a great writer and filmmaker, but that doesn’t make up for his behavior. This is relevant (and the last time I’ll mention it) because a good portion of this movie has Cyborg in it. The majority of his scenes were heavily cut from the first movie. Like 90% majority.\r\n\r\nI appreciate Zack wanting his vision to get out - every director has the right to tell a story the way they want to - but I wish that he’d step away from the writing process. He’s a great filmmaker but not a great storyteller. He needs a writer that has synergy with him.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the special effects are very well done, although I REALLY wish the comics would have been honored better. Simple things like the way the Boom Tubes were portrayed would have been great fan service. Also, the boxes are FATHER Boxes. A Mother Box is a little bit larger than a cellphone. Father Boxes are used for evil on Apokolips and the Mother Box is used for good on New Genesis. If a feministic agenda caused that change, then I disagree with the studio’s decision and a quick 15-second explanation (like what I just did) would have solved that problem and added more to the plot (all the while giving a nod to the New Gods). Yes, I’m critical but it’s important.\r\n\r\nMy favorite of the cast is Gal Gadot. She captures the essence of Wonder Woman perfectly. I also like Ben Affleck as Batman - I’ve always supported him in the role and he does a really good job with it. In fact, he’s second only to MIchael Keaton.\r\nNow this is where I’m probably going to get a lot of hate, so if if happens...bring it on…\r\n\r\nEVERYONE else in the cast I hate. EVERYONE.\r\n\r\nEzra Miller is easily the worst Barry Allen ever. He’s supposed to be Barry, but he acts like an immature Wally. Absolutely terrible.\r\n\r\nI HATE Henry Cavill as Superman. He’s bottom of the list for me. I think Man Of Steel sealed that opinion for me, but he’s just terrible. His suit in this was sharp, so I’ll give credit where it’s due.\r\n\r\nRay Fisher actually didn’t do a terrible job as Cyborg, but I’d never put Cyborg in the Justice League. If they wanted a robot-type character, they could have easily used Red Tornado.\r\nJason Momoa is just awful. He’s not Aquaman. I don’t care that he doesn’t have blond hair. He doesn’t fit the role. It would have been much better if he was cast as Lobo. He’s a much better fit there.\r\n\r\nWe also get a brief cameo by another Justice Leaguer that was a wasted opportunity but sets up a sequel that will probably never happen.\r\n\r\nI understand that Zack likes big spectacular shots in his movies. I understand that he wants these heroes to be larger than life. However, his style is very arthouse - there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. There’s quite a few superheroes that would benefit from that style of filmmaking. These aren’t those superheroes. Zack needs to understand that many times less is more.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this movie is an anomaly. It’s an improvement on the first movie, but it’s not better. It tried to do so much, but had the individual hero movies come out first, there would have been so much more to the story. Instead, everything is crammed into this four hour long beast that doesn’t accomplish as much as it wanted.\r\n\r\nBecause of the improvements, and only because of the improvements I can only give this a 3 out of 5.","created_at":"2021-04-18T01:46:20.225Z","id":"607b8f6cab68490058bec703","updated_at":"2021-06-23T17:03:00.263Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/607b8f6cab68490058bec703"},{"author":"rodricama07","author_details":{"name":"","username":"rodricama07","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73e1439ac0030aec8864cb97cf2b3ed8.jpg","rating":null},"content":"Say what you want about this movie!

I was physically cringing at almost every scene. These problems are completely wiped away in the Snyder Cut allowing for a more character focused and emotional telling of the dawn of the Justice League. The entire film is completely different, with scenes completely cut and the order adjusted to have a more organic viewing experience.\r\n\r\nWith a runtime of four hours, I was really nervous of feeling bored or the movie having a large amount of filler to pad the runtime, but that is not the case. Each scene is crafted perfectly to deliver important character depth, allowing the viewer to gain an emotional connection with each of our heroes. Cyborg, Flash, and Aquaman all have very fleshed out introductions, giving the audience a glimpse of their motivations and struggles living in a world with their powers. Cyborg has a tremendous arc with his struggling relationship with his father, which gets great pay off in the end of the film. The Flash feels grounded too with his motivation for fighting crime to help prove his father's innocence. With this new perspective and tone, his quips feel more like that of an immature kid (much like Spider-Man) rather than infused comedy that was forced by the corporate overlords.\r\n\r\nBatman and Wonder Woman are great in this film, with each giving arguably their best performance as their respective characters. Batman feels like a man who has truly learned from his past mistakes and wants to gather and lead his team rather than divide. Wonder Woman is a confident bad-ass Amazon who's heartfelt and understanding presence is the glue that holds the team together. Aquaman does not have all that much of an arc in this film but has a great lead into his solo movie which is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nNot only are the hero's more fleshed out but so are the villains. Steppenwolf has an actual motivation that the audience can sympathize with and understand. This leads him to feel more genuine in his conquest to take over the world. Steppenwolf plays really well with the backdrop of Darkseid who is looming in the background of every scene of our villain. It really creates a relationship akin to the Emperor and Darth Vader. The introduction of the life equation adds much more stakes and an emphasis on what the conquest is actually about.\r\n\r\nThe action in this movie is great. The R rating added more room for the scenes to be more brutal and visceral with blood and gore, and even a beheading! While the majority of the film had pretty decent CGI, there were a few scenes that looked really out of place. Especially the ones with Darkseid and his lackies, which reminded me of a character straight out of a PS2 game. This largely had to do with the limited budget and time constraints the Synder Cut was given.\r\nThis film delivers on Zach Snyder's vision of Justice League, and I am so happy it exists. Although it also brings a sense of sadness as well, because the movie sets up for so much potential for the DCEU and now that future has all but vanished.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _88%_\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_","created_at":"2022-07-13T14:46:58.390Z","id":"62cedae2b9744203ba6b459b","updated_at":"2022-07-15T15:20:27.960Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62cedae2b9744203ba6b459b"},{"author":"Martha","author_details":{"name":"Martha","username":"MonsterMartha","avatar_path":null,"rating":8.0},"content":"Yes it IS better than the previous version.

Surprisingly even after the 4 hour run time, I was left wanting more. The cast was superb at making these impervious characters with godlike power experience pain, loss, and emotion. The existence of this film is cinematic history in and of itself is a miracle. A director's cut with zero studio interference and such a drastic difference from the studio's original release ever seeing the light of day is astounding. And I am so glad it did.

This is not a bad strategy. An hour at a time of this gargantuan abomination is more than any thinking person can bear. ZSJL reminds me of Ambrose Bierce's famous book review; “The covers of this book are too far apart.” It doesn't help either that half the movie seems to occur in slow motion.\r\n\r\nSuperman's quote-unquote death has resulted in the reactivation of the “Mother Boxes” and the appearance of Darkseid's servant Steppenwolf on Earth. Steppenwolf hails from Apokolips, a planet that exists on a different plane of existence from the regular DC Universe, in spite of which he speaks perfect English, and his name is a German word for an animal presumably found only on Earth.\r\n\r\nSteppenwolf retrieves a Mother Box from Themyscira, following a battle of incredible proportions – not because it involves mythological beings and alien deities, but because the world of the Amazons is almost entirely computer generated, its scenery only slightly more sophisticated than an Age of Empires screenshot.\r\n\r\nHow can this movie ask us to believe in a place like Themyscira, when the film itself doesn't seem to have much faith in its existence? This is symptomatic of ZSJL, much of which takes place in a setting completely divorced from the real world – and my complaint is not that it's unrealistic, because ZSJL is fantasy after all; my problem is that it's not real. I mean, it's just not there.\r\n\r\nOther than as childhood wish fulfillment, true-blue superheroes are very hard – sometimes even impossible, as with the immortal, omnipotent Superman – to identify with or care about; their physical and moral perfection renders them boring and predictable. ZSJL makes it even harder by placing them in front of green/blue screens most of the time, constantly surrounded by wall-to-wall CGI, and unconvincingly engaging enemies who are literally an afterthought – digitally added in post-production, and very poorly at that.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of characters that are nothing short of caricatures, there’s Flash (Ezra Miller). Barry Allen is annoying, irritating, obnoxious, insufferable, grating. He's like a very fast Jar Jar Binks. He's like the bastard son of Andy Dick and French Stewart. If he's so quick, why does it take him so long to get off my screen?\r\n\r\nAll things considered, there's nothing here we haven't seen in Avengers. Darkseid is Thanos, the Mother Boxes are the Infinity Stones, Batman is Ironman, etc., etc. The one difference is that Zack Snyder's Justice League is, though I would not have thought it possible, longer and more boring than any Marvel movie. The only thing that alleviates the overwhelming oppressiveness are the brief interventions of Willem Dafoe and Jeremy Irons, whose considerable talents are wasted on this debacle.","created_at":"2022-08-27T04:03:03.114Z","id":"63099777dcb6a30083593f34","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:29:08.326Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63099777dcb6a30083593f34"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":13},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1612493,"title":"Zack

Disney has created in the last years.

So Disney has done it again.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.\r\n\r\nOkay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.\r\n\r\nSo the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.\r\n\r\nThese days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.\r\n\r\nThe Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n8/10","created_at":"2016-06-04T15:57:17.183Z","id":"5752fa5d925141187e0021a6","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:48.002Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5752fa5d925141187e0021a6"},{"author":"whatowatch","author_details":{"name":"","username":"whatowatch","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d31d5ca3c253e84d23abb0893d8872cb.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Zootopia is the latest family animation movie from Disney about a young bunny determined to be a cop at all costs  – in a land where only 'predators' are cops, she would be the first ‘prey’ cop. Seriously? Anyway, she puts on the hard work and makes it to the land where anything is possible.\r\n\r\nZootopia makes some good real life comparisons: Zootopia itself seems to look like New York, even including a hustle by a sly fox.  Racism seems to be ever present in both color and speech. But the best thing about Zootopia is Judy’s positive attitude and relentless determination to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe animation is as good as a Pixar animation – perfectly made  – and the story is well told, full of action scenes and funny moments. Kids will definitely love this one and grown up kids will enjoy the deep thought provoking tones set in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe best performance in this movie arguably comes from Police Chief Bogo whose voice is played by Idris Elba. His performance should earn him an Oscar this year! No wonder it has grossed 1 Billion dollars worldwide despite little marketing. \r\n\r\nRated 9 out of 10 only because we cannot give it a 10.","created_at":"2016-08-07T11:17:07.921Z","id":"57a718b3c3a368255b0017d8","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:49.987Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/57a718b3c3a368255b0017d8"},{"author":"Austin Singleton","author_details":{"name":"Austin Singleton","username":"hweird1","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bb138661ab394372b93b23fddb57bda.jpg","rating":null},"content":"A great movie with a great message.

It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.\r\n\r\nAlmost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.\r\n\r\nOverall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.","created_at":"2017-02-27T10:22:37.733Z","id":"58b3fded92514177d1016987","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:55.137Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58b3fded92514177d1016987"},{"author":"mattwilde123","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mattwilde123","avatar_path":"/wCTsgKvihctPGp4Ms7Y373baeHm.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"This film is named 'Zootopia' in the US but the title was changed when it was shown in the UK. I thought it is a very good children's film. Very well animated. Colourful. Really cute animals.\r\n\r\nIt is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof).\r\nThe voice acting is very good and each actor perfectly adds to their character.\r\n\r\n★★★★","created_at":"2017-03-09T15:06:04.310Z","id":"58c16f5c925141732f00b2c6","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:55.443Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58c16f5c925141732f00b2c6"},{"author":"Neeraj","author_details":{"name":"Neeraj","username":"johnash95","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9db2be782959bd6afffbed2de37cb903.jpg","rating":null},"content":"Zootopia is an allegorical tale which subtly takes on vast topics like racism, politics and society.

The creative design of the titular city, and the astonishing world building.\r\n\r\n2. Using colors and deliberately simple animation not just to make the movie appeal to children, but also to indicate the so-called ideal city of Zootopia where every animal is pure and innocent.\r\n\r\n3. Blending more than one genre into a single animated film while keeping the plot spotless and not messy.\r\n\r\n4. Delivering many contemporary messages and tackling some quite touchy timely themes that have never been explored in an animated film before. And by giving the priority to the center message, that of prejudice, nothing felt muddled and all over the place, since no message overshadowed the other.\r\n\r\n5. Using the on-the-surface message (achieve one's ambition) as a characteristic of the main character (Judy Hopps), not as the actual main message. That makes this message works as a motive not as a major theme in the movie as in, for instance, Wreck-It Ralph (I LOVE it, though ♥).\r\n\r\n6. Avoiding being over-sentimental, although Nick's character could have been easily used to manipulate our feelings.\r\n\r\nThis movie is an absolute masterpiece. Not only because its wonderful way that gives its many messages in, but also because the importance of its messages in themselves, and how smart and relevant they are. Today, children really need to be taught these morals.\r\n\r\nThe talented cast's voices fit their characters perfectly. It has a plenty of funny scenes littered with extremely hilarious jokes which we haven't heard before in any animated movie, or even in a live-action movie. This movie blends so many genres: Comedy, Adventure, Action, Crime, and Mystery. That said, you will never feel confused while watching it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are definitely some of the most complicated characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. Each character has its own point of view due to the experiences they had, and thus makes each character has different motives and feelings.\r\n\r\n(10/10)","created_at":"2019-06-25T22:19:50.620Z","id":"5d129e06c3a36870fc1e5af8","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:23.638Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d129e06c3a36870fc1e5af8"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"I like <em>'Zootopia'</em>, it's much better than I had anticipated.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the animation is superb - as we expect from Disney of course, but that doesn't change the fact. Ginnifer Goodwin (Judy) leads the cast very well, while Jason Bateman gives the most memorable performance as Nick. Idris Elba and Jenny Slate (not Edie Falco or Constance Shulman, as I initially guessed... just me? Probably) are good too.\r\n\r\nThe premise is actually my favourite part of this film. I'm not saying it's anything revolutionary, but it actually feels fresh throughout - I enjoyed seeing it play out, it's paced perfectly. There's a nice <em>'Breaking Bad'</em> reference in there, too.\r\n\r\nAn entertaining 2016 animated film, one that also has a positive message.

Unfortunately, not everyone managed to escape from the collapsing dome and poor old \"Peeta\" is being used, shamelessly, by the authorities to try and paint \"Katniss\" as the epitome of revolution and evil and so the scene is set: rescue him and mass their forces for an attack that will eliminate the totalitarian regime once and for all. Aside from one of two combat scenes, very little actually happens here. There is a great deal of dialogue, plenty of moralising and if I'm honest, \"Coin\" doesn't come across as any more trustworthy than the man she hopes to succeed. There simply isn't enough by way of plot to sustain this for two hours and the acting still, largely, refuses to engage me. Liam Hemsworth (\"Gale\") features a little more, but the confused does she/doesn't she romance stuff is exasperating as this supposedly emotionally and sexually charged environment delivers nothing by way of passion - indeed the pace of the whole thing borders on the racial. Sure, it looks great but I feel that the writing is very much on the wall for part two - my expectations are pretty low.","created_at":"2022-04-27T09:41:28.071Z","id":"62690fc8f9253216228aa396","updated_at":"2022-04-27T10:23:50.999Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62690fc8f9253216228aa396"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1398134,"title":"The

Following straight on from the frustratingly incomplete scene setter that was Deathly Hallows Part 1, we continue to track Harry, Hermione and Ron as they search for the remaining Horcruxes that will render the evil Lord Voldermort as a mere mortal. This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry.

Smartly the pic has been kept to a 2 hour and 10 minute run time, and thankfully it flows nicely and the pace never stalls. Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.\r\n\r\nAs the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others  held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.\r\n\r\nIs it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well?

That would be The Bishop (Gadot), a mysterious criminal who always seems one step ahead of Booth in the quest to reunite three priceless jeweled eggs that Marc Antony once gave to Cleopatra. Yes, Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nAfter a snappy, parkour-heavy chase to open the film, Hartley offers Booth the chance to move up to the top spot on Interpol’s Red Notice (highest level arrest warrant) list.

It is a movie that makes no pretense other than to be entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a mixture of art heist thriller, Indiana Jones inspired treasure hunts and fast and furious chase action. All served with a large dose of humor.\r\n\r\nI have to confess one thing right away. Ryan Reynolds grated on me. I guess he was chosen to provide most of the comic relief and, to me, he is over the top silly not to mention dishonest (most of the time) in a way that was not really my cup of tea.\r\n\r\nLuckily Dwayne Johnson largely compensated for that. I have not yet seen a movie with Dwayne Johnson in that I felt was really bad. Also, sorry to all the Gal Gadot haters out there, I did like her in this movie but then, as guy, maybe I am a wee bit biased on that, you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nThe story is bordering on the ludicrous with, mostly predictable, twists around every corner but then it is just there to tie the action sequences and jokes together so it is good enough.\r\n\r\nThis is a movie that you watch for the silly action, even sillier jokes and, for me at least, because Dwayne Johnson is in it. It has a single purpose and that is to entertain. No bullshit preaching, no finger pointing and no pretense to provide food for your brain.\r\n\r\nI liked it. It allowed me to spend two hours together with my oldest son just being entertained.\r\n\r\nOh, one more proof that it is a movie worthwhile to watch is of course the woke crappy tomatoes score. Note the discrepancy between their far left woke “critics” and the actual audience. Even that bullshit of separating the audience in “verified” and others couldn’t hide the fact that their “critics” are totally out of sync with the audience.","created_at":"2022-04-20T09:08:13.250Z","id":"625fcd7dd1a893009ca6576c","updated_at":"2022-04-20T09:08:13.250Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/625fcd7dd1a893009ca6576c"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"_Red Notice_ is a run of the mill spy adventure with twists, turns, and an inflated runtime that leaves the movie feeling bloated. I was having a decent time in the start of the movie, I enjoyed the back and forth between Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds, the set pieces were great, and the plot was somewhat interesting. But after awhile, the movie got stale as the same style jokes were recycled and the plot kept being strung along. All the acting was fine in the film, but by this point Dwayne Johnson plays Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds. There is no diversity in their acting, every role they take on is the exact same. In the beginning it was fine, but too much of a good thing is not enough. I found myself getting increasingly bored throughout the duration of the film, and the ending was a grind to get through. The twists at the end were interesting, although if I was remotely engaged in the plot I could have spotted it from a mile away. Overall, this film was below average cinema, even after the spending $60m plus on star power.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _45%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Poor_","created_at":"2022-07-16T16:42:21.690Z","id":"62d2ea6d91745b00674290ba","updated_at":"2022-07-16T16:42:21.690Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62d2ea6d91745b00674290ba"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**Red Notice might be imperfect, but it is definitely enjoyable with its mega-star cast and grand adventure.**\r\n\r\nRed Notice is a fun adventure film with the biggest stars, beautiful locations, and spectacular effects while missing the mark in a few places. Still, it is an entertaining movie that is wildly enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously. With a cast boasting three of the most sought-after A-Listers of its day, Red Notice wisely focuses on these characters giving each actor a chance to grace the screen with their unique charm. The movie advances rapidly from action set piece to action set piece. The moments in between are filled with Reynolds and Johnson's playful banter that is funny but not as natural as Kevin Hart's chemistry with Dwayne Johnson. Ryan Reynolds does a great job playing his character that fits his strengths, but there are times when Johnson and Gadot's characters start to venture into Batman and Robin levels of cheesiness. Yes, Red Notice has flaws, but it really is an enjoyable film, and I look forward to its sequels.","created_at":"2022-10-12T14:53:23.988Z","id":"6346d4e3d34eb30079febf57","updated_at":"2022-10-12T14:53:24.092Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6346d4e3d34eb30079febf57"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":5},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1318351,"title":"Red Notice","original_title":"Red Notice","plot_overview":"An Interpol-issued Red Notice is a global alert to hunt and capture the world's most wanted.

The good thing about this movie is that Deadpool is a hero but in a very comedic way, you don't usually expect comedy from a superhero film but this one was full of comedy and the way they treated the plot was amazing, it was there, humor was there in every scene, even when there was fighting or romance or any other scene, the writers managed to add comedy everywhere in a very good way that'll surprisingly make you want to watch it again, and again.

The other reason was, we had other superheroes in our time, so this guy is kind of new to me. It was a stunning launch to the big screen for the Deadpool as well as for this new director. This film was merely an introduction tale than a fully stretched story. Like how a human becomes a mutant and later who seeks a revenge for ruining his natural life. But it yet to explain a couple of things and I hope it all will be revealed in its sequel.\r\n\r\nI am happy for Ryan Reynolds to get another chance, because his previous comic book character did not received well. I certainly liked the film, but nowadays there are plenty of superheroes to choose, in that, Deadpool's not in my top 5. So I am happy he joined the 'X-Men', because I never liked the boring 'X-Men' films or its characters, but I do love its spinoff 'Wolverine'. I'll definitely look forward for his solo films like 'Wolverine'.\r\n\r\nThis film broke a few records like the best box office so far for an 'X-Men' installment. A short film with the present and flashback narration shared the screen piece by piece alternatively. This was a strong R rated film so far I have seen in a superhero theme and there were plenty of other films referred. No offense to the people who liked it (and those who are going watch will do the same), but in my personal opinion it was a bit over-celebrated.\r\n\r\n6½/10","created_at":"2016-05-14T17:08:27.579Z","id":"57375b8bc3a3687e1a0046bf","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:47.659Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/57375b8bc3a3687e1a0046bf"},{"author":"talisencrw","author_details":{"name":"","username":"talisencrw","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbcc9350415274a3c68399bd37ca3ebc.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"Though I have always been a DC enthusiast, I was intrigued by the idea of the Deadpool movie, and knew I'd end up watching it (I probably see 70% of DC films that are released and maybe 20% of Marvel ones).

I wasn't altogether sure that a film that would obviously have to be fun, self-referential and self-aware could also be able to talk about a character who not only becomes seriously ill, but also struggles to keep a grip on his sanity well enough to do the character justice. \r\n\r\nWhen I watched the film, it was clear that I had been over-thinking. Perhaps the makers of the film had thought the same as me. Perhaps they thought that trying to be lighthearted and slightly dark at the same time would be like trying to keep too many balls in the air. I say that because the issue of Deadpool’s sanity, or lack thereof, is only touched upon. If that is the case, I think it is quite a clever decision in a ‘let's not try to run before we can walk’ kind of a way. If not, Tim Miller has still given us a very enjoyable film, in which, Ryan Reynolds shines as an extremely good comedic actor.","created_at":"2017-05-29T01:23:17.816Z","id":"592b7805c3a368783e069f68","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:57.929Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/592b7805c3a368783e069f68"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"After what I honestly think is the best promotional & viral marketing campaign a film has had, probably ever, the Deadpool feature film is finally here! And it's... Alright.\r\n\r\nI always try to manage expectations with these things, but after the aforementioned advertisements as well as multiple critics I highly regard the opinions of raving about it (John Campea of Collider for example gave the film his seventh 5-out-of-5 in his entire career) and my well-documented appreciation for the character of Deadpool, not to mention it's higher MPAA rating, there's only so neutral you can be going in. Still, I don't think my own personal biases had me too overhyped for Deadpool, I think I can fairly lay the lion's share of my underwhelming experience at the film itself.\r\n\r\nI should start out by saying that I didn't dislike Deadpool, I'm giving it a positive rating, and I recommend that people go watch it. Three stars for me is not a low score at all, I am glad I watched the movie and would happily watch it again, this is not a scathing review; Ryan Reynolds has tried his hand at the comic book film no less than five times, and of those five movies, Deadpool is inarguably the best.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that among those other four films, Ryan Reynolds was not the problem in them, but they were all truly bad movies.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Deadpool is done is pretty impressive, we get all the gore-laden action, R-rated comedy, quip-havery and fourth-wall-breaking you could want from a feature of his own. There are lots of meta-references to previous work to the past failings of both Reynolds as well as the Fox Studio itself. It's non-linear. It's 100% non-serious, almost a comedy before an action film. It's like the 22 Jump Street of the superhero genre. Stylistically, it's a completely fresh comic book movie.\r\n\r\nWhich is why the complete juxtaposition of how unbelievably generic the actual plot is, is so jarring. It's not only completely unoriginal, it's sometimes downright bland. The \"how\" is great, but the core of the \"what\" feels completely uninspired, and these two aspects clash up against each other very unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nPoints go out to the work done between Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin, although the majority of their characters' relationship is montaged through, the actors themselves had a great on-screen chemistry. I'm also totally on board for a Deadpool sequel (which has been greenlit) or seeing Deadpool show up in other X-franchise properties. But that doesn't mean I can give Deadpool a pass on the things that didn't gel for me.\r\n\r\n63% \r\n\r\n-Gimly","created_at":"2019-12-29T02:50:22.571Z","id":"5e08146e4c1d9a0015e34b0a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:30.897Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5e08146e4c1d9a0015e34b0a"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":7}},{"id":194187,"title":"Deadpool","original_title":"Deadpool","plot_overview":"The origin story of former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who, after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool.

Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\r\n\r\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\r\n\r\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\r\n\r\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\r\n\r\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\r\n\r\n‘‘This world's a treasure,\r\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’\r\n\r\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\r\n\r\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\r\n\r\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\r\n\r\n‘‘Maybe we've spent too long\r\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.’’\r\n\r\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\r\n\r\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\r\n\r\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.","created_at":"2014-11-12T16:06:04.927Z","id":"5463856c0e0a267815002598","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:30.674Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5463856c0e0a267815002598"},{"author":"decovision","author_details":{"name":"","username":"decovision","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/adb849ea47b2ba2e1971fd2defcf2e4d.jpg","rating":9.5},"content":"People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \r\nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.\r\nI remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. \r\nSince then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.\r\nI read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.\r\nIf you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug.","created_at":"2015-09-12T14:49:33.669Z","id":"55f43b7dc3a3686d03003292","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:37.019Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/55f43b7dc3a3686d03003292"},{"author":"Andres Gomez","author_details":{"name":"Andres Gomez","username":"tanty","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03a53cd53b8254fe582d4fe1acc26c4e.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Another grandiloquent movie from Christoper Nolan.\r\n\r\nThe cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself. The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...\r\n\r\n* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.\r\n* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.\r\n* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the movie is OK but you can only think this is a great movie if you are a real Nolan fan.","created_at":"2015-10-31T12:07:03.650Z","id":"5634aee792514129fe009d2c","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:38.241Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5634aee792514129fe009d2c"},{"author":"Asadullah Khan","author_details":{"name":"Asadullah Khan","username":"Spartan117","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89228741794df8b823084150f152be52.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"\"Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.\"\r\n\r\nIT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.\r\n\r\nThis movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.\r\n\r\nMathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.\r\n\r\nInterstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.\r\n\r\nThe visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.\r\n\r\nAlas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.\r\n\r\nWith all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.\r\n\r\n9.5/10","created_at":"2016-10-19T20:49:49.259Z","id":"5807dc6dc3a3680f2d00319f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:51.694Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5807dc6dc3a3680f2d00319f"},{"author":"shaunfrombklyn","author_details":{"name":"","username":"shaunfrombklyn","avatar_path":"/y898c19QvGWWvEGzEvx4h71lS26.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. \r\n\r\nThe story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.\r\n\r\nBut what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. \r\n\r\nMy only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.\r\n\r\n10/10","created_at":"2017-02-15T14:34:47.716Z","id":"58a46707c3a3686cc200458c","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:54.211Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58a46707c3a3686cc200458c"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.\r\n\r\nThe story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!\r\n\r\nThe movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?\r\n\r\nThe one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.","created_at":"2017-12-21T17:11:31.469Z","id":"5a3beb430e0a264cbc23212a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:03.524Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5a3beb430e0a264cbc23212a"},{"author":"akashmahajan","author_details":{"name":"","username":"akashmahajan","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd861fa20eed5bea19586488cc4633e1.jpg","rating":null},"content":"Again hit produced by christopher nolan after batman.\r\nStoryline is great and also the science theory is perfectly showcased.","created_at":"2018-11-01T17:58:15.939Z","id":"5bdb3eb7c3a3680785012584","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:14.175Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5bdb3eb7c3a3680785012584"},{"author":"sybddlatfu","author_details":{"name":"","username":"sybddlatfu","avatar_path":null,"rating":null},"content":"This might contain spoilers!\r\n---\r\nInterstellar is my favorite movie.

Mystery arrives after a sand storm leaves some magnetic clues to a secret location inhabited by NASA scientists led by \"Brand\" (Sir Michael Caine) who manage to convince former pilot \"Coop\" to join a mission to go into space and, using a recently detected wormhole that he believes may have been deliberately sent to help mankind rescue itself, set off to find another home for us all. Leaving a seriously narked daughter behind, he accepts the mission and together with the daughter of \"Brand\" (Anne Hathaway) their perilous trek begins. This is a more solid sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan. Though it features doses of his usual time bending scenarios, for the most part it is an exciting action film with mishaps a-plenty as their mission sees danger at just about every junction. There is a decent chemistry between Hathaway and McConaughey allowing the characters to develop with some depth that helps to draw us into to their efforts. The visual effects are superb, it has TARS - a rather clunkily designed robot that proves a whizz when running and rescuing, and the ending has something of the Escher drawing to it. The narrative can be thought provoking offering quite an interesting series of choices, especially when Matt Damon (\"Mann\") joins the story and begins to challenge their approach to just what \"humanity\" might actually be! A host of celebrated co-stars prop it up well. John Lithgow is effective as the patriarch of the family and Casey Affleck and Wes Bentley help diffuse the intensity of the principal relationship as the space-bound menace gradually accumulates. It's all but three hours long, and there is no denying that it hits a barren spell at times during the middle hour, but for my money this is a Nolan film that does not over-complicate itself and is as good a science fiction thriller as I've seen in many a

I have not read the book so I'm not really sure what happens. I didn't like New Moon that much. So I wasn't really that excited about watching this movie. I guess, I can say, I went with the flow. I wanted to be one of those people who have seen this movie. It was a holiday because of the President's inauguration. So we went to Podium because I know there will be more people in bigger theaters. Many showtimes were sold out already. So we decided to buy tickets for the last full show. We stayed and played with Toby the whole after noon and after dropping off Edward, straight to Podium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie was much better than New Moon. There's more action and the romance between Jacob and Bella are deeper now. More screen time for the Cullen family. The music is better than New Moon having some songs that are more alike than Twilight. I didn't like the makeup. It was not consistent and Bella's hair was the worst. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is B-. It was nice but nothing beats Twilight still.","created_at":"2017-02-09T10:20:00.365Z","id":"589c4250c3a3686ef9003183","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:53.600Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/589c4250c3a3686ef9003183"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1424748,"title":"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse","original_title":"The Twilight Saga: Eclipse","plot_overview":"Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger as Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge.

I have a gift for you. Your Daddy gave me this, & now I'm going to give it to you. It's very Special { Letty takes off her necklace & puts it around Brian's neck } ...it's for protection... from what's coming\" .\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________ \r\n\r\nFirst & foremost, -{ Not Only }- is this undeniable \"behemoth\" of a movie, with its USD 200 Million -plus- production budget, broadly speaking, **-{ GENUINELY ✅ }-** enjoyable; but it is -Also- \"rather surprisingly\", and very reassuringly so . . . \" relatively \" . . . -very- Family Friendly, indeed. As a doting -{ _P a r e n t_ }- , I had, to be very honest, expected -Considerably- worse; given what the 'seemingly standard trend' with Blockbuster-fare ( on -this- magnitude, atleast ) is, in this... 'our pretty, darn reckless' ..day and age .\r\n\r\nMoreover, I just **-{ LOVE 👏 }-** how the movie ...unreservedly... -not only- \"laughs out loud\" -{ at itself }- of course , but often -Also- seems like it's having a 'rollicking good time' doing it. For -all- the 'Contrarian'-reviewers on a very similar platform to this known as 'IMDb' { that appear absolutely -Bent- on picking this fairly \"lighthearted\" & essentially **\" PLAYFUL \"** picture apart for just about 'every conceivable reason under the sun' }: I have -just- 3 'Profound' words to say to you: \"Watch It Again\". Because that is -just- what I did, & I ended up enjoying it -{ way }- more the second time around ; managing to, on the one hand, clear up -Several- of my initial doubts... & on the other ; to -{ truly }- appreciate how ( actually ) \"Un\"-seriously ...\"F9\" really takes itself. Keep your eye out for the tiny but absolutely -{ hilarious❗}- little \"Who's Dominic Toretto?\" scene ; you'll get a better feel for what I mean. But let me be ..\"Starkly\".. clear. -{ In no way }- is my review title meant to suggest to you, -even remotely- , that this is somehow 'the best cinematic offering on earth' right now, or -any- such manner of preposterous thing. The pointed -{ reason }- , as it were, for my use of the -decidedly- \" Lively \" , Benignly Parodical, & even \"mildly histrionic\" , film review -Title- that you see above, is, quite simply , 'as follows' .\r\n\r\n----- \" It's a well known fact by now that the -{ Ever }- grandiose pictures of the 'Fast And Furious' franchise seem to -forever- be looking to \" One Up Themselves \" , in terms of making their vehicular ( in particular ) action sequences -{ well and truly }- \" One-Of-A-Kind \" . In keeping with this 'practically-Sacrosanct ( 🙏 😅 )' , time honoured tradition . . . . F9's very accomplished 'In-house' writer-Director Justin Lin has ( -Yet- ) again proven that he most certainly is the very 'living embodiment' of this rule, by taking those wild & wacky ( bespoke ) 'Gas-Guzzler Gymnastics' of his all the way , you guessed it , to -{ Outer Space }- . . . . not to mention all the -many, many- other ( almost ) as utterly, utterly, utterly '_Ludacris_' stunts performed ...seemingly as if... 'by all those Mega-fancy automobiles themselves'. ( Watch the final -official- trailer for F9 , if it's still going to be a while before said movie hits your part of the world ). So there you have it. Hence that 'affectionate little touch' of, well , \" Classic-hyperbole \" , in my review-Title . \" ----- \r\n\r\nAnd so, in closing, here are the things I consider to be the -{ Most }- likeable, about the picture. 1 : The ever-fresh, ever-sweet rapport that 'Dominic Toretto' ( Vin Diesel ) has with 'Letty Ortiz' ( Michelle Rodriguez ). 2 : The { Un }-deniable \" Brilliance 🌠 \" , really , with which -Several- mind bogglingly complex, & indeed, 'super-Protracted' multiple vehicle chase & combat scenes were put together. 3 : -All- those \"giant-Magnet special effects\", ( this is -Also- teased in the trailers, which are freely available to watch on youtube ), meticulously crafted to, frankly, \".nothing less than sheer -{ Perfection }- \" . 4 : The film's -{ Delectable }- smattering of short, nonetheless utterly -Classic- \" Movie-Reincarnation sequences \" . Meaning . . . { action or comedy ( or both ) 'Re-works' of -Well- established , ( & often beloved, even ) , \" Universally Iconic Cinematic-moments \" } . . . which in the case of F9 ...{ Un }-mistakably... were sequences that hearkened -Right- back to a few ( very ) specific, timeless, & -Massively- popular scenes from A : 'Jurrasic Park-Part One', B : 'Terminator Three-Rise Of The Machines' ( **-OR-** 'The Dark Knight' : your prefererence, really ), & C : 'Austin Powers-Part One', -even- , just to name the ( Most 💙 ) notable ones. 5 : And last but by no means the least : there really -{ Was }- a whole lot of -actually- funny stuff in F9. And I am, -of course- referring here to -Very- many moments of \"Unabashedly-Dumb Frivolity\" involving , ( but not limited to ) ; none other than the \" Uber-talented \" Tyrese Gibson, ( 'Roman' ), & his -equally- Fun partner-in-comedy, Ludacris ( 'Tej' ) ; with the ever charming Nathalie Emmanuel ( 'Ramsey' ) chiming in 'most pleasantly' from time to time, for good measure . \r\n\r\nSummary : If you -{ Didn't }- come to F9 to see cars flying in, well, -outer space- , ( and other such \" _Colossally_ \" Zany-things ) , then you -most certainly- came to the wrong place. { Translation } : if you're ( one of those ) the -'Many, Many'- ( aforementioned ) negative-reviewers, and feel like you were ( -better- ) suited to simply watching 'Normal' cars just driving around, well... 'Normally' ...& -{ Not }- doing a multitude of \"crazy & extraordinary\" things ; then can I -very humbly- recommend, say, ....going & sitting down at a nearby bus-stop, & watching 'The Street'.... -{ Instead }- . Because, 'for better or worse', -this- movie does -{ Exactly }- what it says on the tin , \" & Then Some \" . Furthermore, the two -Main- Male \"Lead-pairs\", namely, A : Vin Diesel and John Cena ; and B : Vinnie Bennett and Finn Cole, ( a.k.a 'Young Dom', and 'Young Jakob' ), play -{ remarkably }- well off one another ; whilst -All- the \"Leading Ladies\" plunge headfirst into this veritable, **-{ MINDLESS }-** Fun-Fest , \" With A Vengeance \" .

Moving forward to the present day, Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), are living in seclusion with Dom’s son.\r\n\r\nWhen the crew shows up unexpectedly with a mission from Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell); who has gone missing, the crew venture out to retrieve a missing device which in turn puts them directly in the path with nefarious individuals and a ghost from Dom’s past.\r\n\r\nAs anyone who has watched any films in the series knows; the plots are often thin and a bit absurd as they serve simply as a device for the cast to assemble and chase a McGuffin to save the day. In doing so; the audience knows there will be an abundance of fists, bullets, cars, crashes, and outrageous stunts along the way.\r\n\r\nWhile reality and credibility are not words associated with the franchise, the cast eagerly plays along with the absurdity, action, and mayhem and gives fans what they want. While the middle portion dragged while the audience was given more of the setup and introduced to cast members old and new; the action sequences are the over-the-top show stoppers which have become a staple of the franchise.\r\n\r\nDirector Justin Lin knows this and his return to the franchise does not attempt to invoke any new wrinkles and gives fans what they expect. The large ensemble works well with one another and John Cena is a very interesting addition to the cast.\r\n\r\nAudiences will want to make sure to stay seated for a bonus scene that sets up the next film or spin-off very well and opens up some very interesting possibilities.\r\n\r\nIn the end “F9 The Fast Saga” gives audiences a dose of high-octane adrenaline and a return to no-brainer over the top action when it is needed the most. Check your brain at the door, strap in, and enjoy the ride.\r\n3.5/5","created_at":"2021-06-21T21:20:58.346Z","id":"60d102bac9dbf900270a3e89","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:57.120Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60d102bac9dbf900270a3e89"},{"author":"Peter89Spencer","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Peter89Spencer","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dadb1b759a8516c815cdcc58abcefc85.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"This delay was worth waiting for...\r\n\r\nFirst of, it was really cool how they did the flashback; looked like it was filmed in a retro camera, which made it look like it was filmed in the 1989/90s!.

Justin Lin ignores the little balance that the saga still possesses in previous installments, delivering insanely dumb moments throughout entire set pieces, contrary to having a somewhat acceptable action scene with the occasional suspension of disbelief in a specific situation. Daniel Casey and Lin are also unable to create a compelling narrative around Dom's lost brother, ultimately damaging years of character development for Vin Diesel's role. Bringing back Han was as unnecessary as the unconvincing explanation for his return, hurting not only this movie's pacing and extended runtime but also the emotional weight of previous films. The original cast members and the exceptional production value are enough to save this installment from being a massive disaster. If you're able to (really) shut down your brain for over two hours, this might still be an entertaining time at the theater. However, even for fans of the Fast & Furious saga, I doubt this movie will end up as one of your favorites.\"\r\n\r\nRating: D+","created_at":"2021-06-27T18:13:31.965Z","id":"60d8bfcbaa7898005d562dff","updated_at":"2021-06-27T18:13:31.965Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60d8bfcbaa7898005d562dff"},{"author":"zmmetz","author_details":{"name":"","username":"zmmetz","avatar_path":null,"rating":2.0},"content":"I didn't heed everyone's advice and decided I would view this for myself.\r\n\r\nYikes!!

Yes, they are dumb and have over-the-top action, CGI-generated, scenes yet despite that found them to be mindless entertainment with the only merit being the chemistry with the cast. However, with Fate of the Furious and the absence of Paul Walker, the series lost that aspect. Walker wasn't a great actor but he and Diesel were great together, along with the others in the ensemble where I could overlook the stupid moments.\r\n\r\nThis ninth entry, as most sequels do, takes it to the next level of absurdity but this time I really could not care less about anything going on. The action scenes were pretty lame and even though it was a joke taking the movie into space, I didn't think they'd actually do it... I could only shake my head at that sequence.\r\n\r\nThen there's the whole bringing Han back to life. They have now retconned his scene for a second time and somehow, despite this being an outlandish franchise, cheapens any character development for Deckard Shaw (his entire reason for \"killing\" Han was out of revenge for putting his brother in a coma, although IIRC initially Owen Shaw was thought to have been killing in Fast Five).\r\n\r\nThey try to add some BS depth with faith and, of course, FAMILY, that doesn't land. Hell, there's even discussion from Roman (Tyrese) about being invincible played as a joke only to come true once he and Tej go into space to stop a satellite and actually f'ing survive.\r\n\r\nThe film also is a greatest hits with the return of characters from previous entries including Helen Mirren, Lucas Black, Kurt Russell, Charlize Theron, Shea Whigham (had to look him up, he was in Furious 6), Sung Kang, Shad Moss (aka Bow Wow), etc. Plus Jason Statham makes an uncredited cameo.\r\n\r\nBoy, yeah the Fast franchise jumped the shark a while back but this one is on the bottom of the list. I don't know how they will right the ship with #10 (and supposedly the last) but the issue with these sequels is they have to top the previous no matter what.\r\n\r\nDumb is fine.

That means that these movies are not to everyone’s taste (which no movies really are for that matter) but it seems a lot of those people have watched this movie anyway and then pretends to be surprised.\r\n\r\nThose who give this movie one star ratings have obviously never seen a real one star movie and those asshats that start their review with “I left after xx minutes” are just trolls. If you have not watched the movie, all of it, don’t write a bloody “review”.\r\n\r\nTo me this movie was pretty much what I expected. Perhaps even a bit more silly and over the top than the previous ones, not that this was much of a surprise, but still more or less what I expected.\r\n\r\nIt has a half decent, quite predictable, story that’s just good enough to tie the action sequences together. I do whish stupid Hollywood writers that probably never finished basic school would stop write stories with their favorite “device yyy which can take over all electronics” bullshit in them. Apart from being total scientific nonsense it is really, really overused.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel is Vin Diesel. I cannot remember many, if any, movies where I have not liked his character. His team is pretty likable as well although some of their silly shenanigans and ramblings was indeed a bit tiresome from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe core of the movie is of course the action and special effects. Sure, they are incredibly over the top and for the most of the time you have to put your brain in idle when watching them but if you, like me, like special effects this is a movie for you. The silly scene where the bad guys “tank train” flipped over was a bit too much for me as well but on the whole I enjoyed the action.\r\n\r\nI was not too thrilled with all the flashbacks but then I almost never like flashbacks and there was plenty of them in this movie.\r\n\r\nI would have liked Chipher to have a bigger role in the movie. She is cool as well as intelligent which is not something that really could be said about Dom’s brother. The main bad guy was just a jerk and not very charismatic. Hollywood really seems to have a problem writing good bad guys lately.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was some well spent almost two and a half hours (I watched the directors cut). I quite enjoyed this movie.","created_at":"2021-12-20T16:35:13.445Z","id":"61c0b0c14da3d40063bdf1bb","updated_at":"2021-12-20T16:35:13.445Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61c0b0c14da3d40063bdf1bb"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Well they did sub-title this a \"saga\", but I wasn't quite expecting something this poor. Things didn't auger well when the cinema screen broke down and we were turfed out after thirty minutes. Next week, back for part two - complete with \"an opportunity to refresh our memories\" as the cinema lad put it... Sadly, though, the first half hour provides us with easily the most entertaining elements of this otherwise weak story bereft of just about everything bar some super stunts/visual effects and Charlize Theron locked up in a plastic cage. There is some effort made to create some characters, and Vin Diesel does bring a certain degree of charisma to the screen, but after an initial flurry of decent motor sport action, we drop from a great height into a family revenge/melodrama that has only one, entirely predictable, conclusion. It is a piece of harmless escapism that serves to divert us from reality for an extremely overlong 2 hrs and 20 minutes but this franchise really misses Paul Walker and although I'm sure nobody will listen, this is not much of a testament to his memory and ought to be the last unless someone is going to revamp the concept thoroughly and invest in solid stories and characters to compliment the endless, and increasingly sterile, visuals.

Right off the bat, Roman finds himself in a predicament that even Wile E. would find preposterous. Following a miraculous escape, Roman begins to suspect what Cipher (Charlize Theron) seems to already know; that they are all characters in an action movie. Sadly, the film doesn't pursue this direction which would be far more interesting than the Long Lost Brother tale it settles for.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) has a brother, Jakob (John Cena). Like the laws of physics, Dom had never let on that this brother ever even existed. Thus, we get a series of expository flashbacks to provide some background for this new character; you know, so that it doesn’t appear as if they just pulled him out of fucking nowehere.\r\n\r\nThese trips down amnesia lane are what truly sinks the movie. F9 uses the format popularized by The Godfather Part II, in which Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone in the 'present' and Robert De Niro plays Vito Corleone in extended flashbacks.\r\n\r\nNow, Diesel and Cena are no Pacino or De Niro, but they are two unique individuals endowed with clearly defined personalities and who happen to ooze charisma and self-confidence. In comparison, the actors who play their younger versions are such non-entities that they almost make a good case for digital de-aging (almost). As a result of this, F9 loses all the momentum it has gathered in the contemporary scenes every time it looks back.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Cena is too obviously a Red Herring; there's a reason he played a 'heroic' character in WWE for roughly 15 years, and it's because he couldn't be a convincing villain even if his life depended on it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, skilled performers like Kurt Russell, Shea Whigham, Michael Rooker, and Helen Mirror are wasted in peripheral roles (not to mention Theron, who spends most of her screen time literally locked inside a transparent box, leaving us to wonder what she does when she has to go to the bathroom), the filmmakers seemingly operating under the impression that they must perforce make room for each and every character who has ever made an appearance at some point in the series.\r\n\r\nApart from those already mentioned, we briefly see Lucas Black, Don Omar, Bow Wow, Jason Tobin, Gal Gadot, and Jason Statham in a cameo during the closing credits (unseen by me because once the credits roll, I’m outta there). About the only exception is of course Paul Walker (but not, as one might have reasonably expected, the one who had supposedly died in an explosion in a previous installment), whose character, from what we hear, has been reduced to babysitting Dom's son and his own. Is that the true Fate of the Furious?","created_at":"2022-09-03T16:50:43.343Z","id":"631385e3564ec700915d162a","updated_at":"2022-09-03T16:50:43.445Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/631385e3564ec700915d162a"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":11},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"F9:

I mean, who hasn’t seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you’re one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I’m just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don’t really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven’t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!\r\n\r\nI rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That’s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can’t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia’s tears. Mufasa’s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole “remember who you are” speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer‘s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It’s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an “okay” scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a “good” movie turn into a “great” one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn’t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.\r\n\r\nDuring the stampede sequence, the score doesn’t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It’s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it’s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba’s roar … Damn it, I’m crying again!\r\n\r\nThe animation is some of Disney’s best. It’s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone’s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There’s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they’re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone’s wallpaper even today.\r\n\r\nThe songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, … Every single song is someone’s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career’s biggest role, Darth Vader isn’t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character’s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who’s the “bad guy”, and that’s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It’s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba’s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it’s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can’t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.\r\n\r\nIt’s a masterpiece! It doesn’t matter if it’s an animated film. It doesn’t matter if it was “made for kids”. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it’s undeniably one of Disney’s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs … The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its “live-action” remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.\r\n\r\nRating: A+","created_at":"2019-07-18T08:05:27.472Z","id":"5d302847caab6d1640a01bd4","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:24.556Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d302847caab6d1640a01bd4"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1403455,"title":"The Lion King","original_title":"The Lion King","plot_overview":"A young lion prince is cast out of his pride by his cruel uncle, who claims he killed his father.

Harry faces getting expelled and finds himself shunned by many around him. This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that \"you know who\" is not back again.\r\n\r\nGiven that JK Rowling's fifth book is considered to be something of a door stopper, a book more of interim Potter filler than any great amount of substance, credit has to go to new to the franchise director, David Yates. For Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to craft a briskly entertaining segment in under 2 hours and 20 minutes of film. Yes it's safe to say that it ultimately does feel like an interim filler movie, one that is for fans and not newcomers to the series, but the effects are superb (except Grawp that is), the action is much and suspense is not in short supply. While it also finds Radcliffe as Potter finally hitting his acting stride.\r\n\r\nNew into the magical fray comes the wonderful Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbrage, the sort of cheery psychotic teacher we all had bad dreams about in our formative years. Also most welcome is Helena Bonham Carter as nut job harpy Bellatrix Le Strange, it's an appetiser of substance and we can't wait to see some more of her from here on in. Of course the usual problem of not enough screen time for the regulars still exists, but it's now become a figure of grumpy acceptance in the grand scheme of Potter World. Neatly keeping the story trimmed of extraneous fat, Yates doesn't disappoint in delivering a last quarter as memorable as any so far in the series. Big rewards await those who wait, because the showdown that crowns Order of Phoenix is a magical mêlée of wands and wonderment; a face off between good and evil, a free for all that joyously assaults the senses.\r\n\r\nRoll on Half-Blood Prince, where it's great to know that Yates has been further entrusted with the Harry Potter reins. 7.5/10","created_at":"2019-08-20T23:40:20.626Z","id":"5d5c84e46743fa00116f04a2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:25.571Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d5c84e46743fa00116f04a2"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1159478,"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","original_title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","plot_overview":"Returning for his fifth year of study at Hogwarts, Harry is stunned to find that his warnings about the return of Lord Voldemort have been ignored.

Book 7 is my favorite Harry Potter book so being able to see it on film is really exciting. I was satisfied. I know I won't see everything that I read in the movie although there were some parts wherein I wished I saw it like the goodbye of the Dursleys to Harry. It made me tear up while reading the book but I didn't really see it in the film. Also, the way how Hedwig died in the film did not make that big of an impact. I was surprised though in the part where Harry and Hermione kissed. It was in the book but in the movie, they were naked! I was really surprised. And then Hermione looks gorgeous as always and Harry looked good in the movie too. The part where Harry and Hermione danced was not in the book but I liked that part. Harry looked cute for me in that part. \r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, I was satisfied. I'm looking forward to watch the next part and I can't wait. My rate for this movie is A.","created_at":"2017-02-09T10:15:12.120Z","id":"589c4130925141254b00343d","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:53.586Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/589c4130925141254b00343d"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1159474,"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1","original_title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1","plot_overview":"Harry, Ron and Hermione walk away from their last year at Hogwarts to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes, putting an end to Voldemort's bid for immortality.

Roland Emmerich has essentially made an even dumber version of Michael Bay’s Armageddon. There’s not a lot to enjoy here apart from K.C. Houseman’s house cat being named Fuzz Aldrin. With its idiotic premise, hammy dialogue involving some of the most exaggerated emotional speeches ever, stiff acting, unfunny humor, and purposely distorted CGI, Moonfall features an overwhelming amount of frenetic nonsense and has no excuse to be as boring as it is.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://boundingintocomics.com/2022/02/04/moonfall-review-its-raining-moon/","created_at":"2022-02-05T02:27:03.725Z","id":"61fde077fcec2e00e14529aa","updated_at":"2022-02-05T02:27:03.725Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61fde077fcec2e00e14529aa"},{"author":"tmdb81678279","author_details":{"name":"","username":"tmdb81678279","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"After watching the movie, I thought that if I had watched it on a streaming platform I would wish I caught it in the cinemas. Luckily I watched it on an IMAX cinema so the screen was huge and the sound was great, dialague was loud and clear. It had an entense tone to it to keep my attention. There were jokes here and there, but nothing major to distract me at all. I liked that it starts a bit slow and builds up, the second half is what remind me why I go to the cinemas, non-stop action and greatly done shots that you wish to put on your computer screen. It's science fiction film that captivates your imagination. The plot and ideas I found very interesting. I enjoyed the movie, so I would recommend to catch it in the cinemas. Bigger cinema, the better. My only complaint is that it couldn't take advantage of the full IMAX screen that was available, probably due to budget constraints.","created_at":"2022-02-09T11:10:03.254Z","id":"6203a10bea37e0009451a99f","updated_at":"2022-02-17T17:54:00.170Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6203a10bea37e0009451a99f"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"A bit messy, this.\r\n\r\n<em>'Moonfall'</em> is actually good in areas that I was expecting it to be bad in and bad in areas I thought it might've been good in. I had caught one of the trailers - at the cinema for a different film - and didn't hold high hopes for it, especially with the <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dont-look-up-2021/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Don't Look Up</a>'</em> similarity, though thought the humour/silliness might carry it over the line.\r\n\r\nYet, the humour is poor and it's in fact the more serious elements that come to the fore. I honestly enjoyed the sci-fi bits of it and the more dramatic stuff. The comedy is very lame, I don't think I even smirked once to be honest. They should've just played it totally straight, in my opinion anyway. The special effects, meanwhile, are a positive.\r\n\r\nThe cast, when not comedic, work fairly well together. Halle Berry, John Bradley - who may be at the front of the limp jokes but he as an actor is likeable enough that I didn't dislike him at all - and Patrick Wilson - who I always forget the name of, I was literally trying to recall him throughout the film and I still didn't crack it - are a solid trio when serious. The support cast, spearheaded by Michael Peña, are meh.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it's a 6/10 rating from me. I do like disaster movies - <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2012</a>'</em>, Roland Emmerich's best, is great - but this one fell short; particularly towards the end. I wouldn't, personally, say it's as bad as that average rating chart suggests, but to each their own of course.","created_at":"2022-02-18T00:16:34.839Z","id":"620ee562aa7898001b5b7e19","updated_at":"2022-02-18T00:19:36.249Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/620ee562aa7898001b5b7e19"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":2.0},"content":"MORE SPOILER-FREE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/\r\n\r\n\"Moonfall is as insanely nonsensical as one could hope/expect, but it's the lack of entertaining sequences for most of the runtime that brings the film down.

kingdom of Arendelle needs to be evacuated when the forces of nature threaten to destroy it. Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Kristoff set off to find some answers. But Elsa has been distracted. She has been hearing an unfamiliar voice calling out to her in a strange tune. Led by her, the group follows the melody to find themselves at the edge of an Enchanted Forest with untold mysteries and dangers.\r\n\r\nRather than retracing the steps of its record-breaking predecessor, ‘Frozen 2’ tries some new thematic tricks. This time around, the surprisingly mature plot focuses on transformation and growing up. The film’s setup leading up to the climax appears to be promising, but its third act doesn’t quite live up to expectations. The conflict resolution lacks a sense of impact and feels rushed. This is particularly baffling since the first half tends to meander, focusing on songs than on purposefully furthering the plot. Additionally, the tracks are far too many and certainly not as catchy as the first film. Which isn’t to say they are bad – the compositions are layered, but it is yet to be seen if they have enough sing-along power to become as popular as ‘Let It Go’. Still, the picturizations of the music is incredibly captivating.\r\n\r\nThis extends to the rest of the film’s animation too, and some vibrant colors combine with photo-realistic visuals to create quite a spectacle. Minor details are noticeable as they enhance the essence of each character. While each of the group gets their moments, Elsa and Anna continue to be the focal points. The uncontainable chemistry of Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell, respectively, picks up where they left off without missing a beat. Olaf provides ample humor, either in visual slapstick or by Josh Gad’s endearing yet tongue-in-cheek, almost self-aware delivery. An interesting new character played by Sterling K. Brown is an immediate standout. However, a subplot involving Kristoff and Anna feels shoed in to give Jonathan Groff something to do besides singing probably the most amusing song in the soundtrack.\r\n\r\nIt’s a tall order to expect this sequel to capture the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of the original, but Frozen 2’s stunning eye-candy and humor will be enjoyable enough for its younger core audience.","created_at":"2019-11-22T19:06:19.410Z","id":"5dd831ab3faba00015f96deb","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:29.268Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5dd831ab3faba00015f96deb"},{"author":"SWITCH.","author_details":{"name":"SWITCH.","username":"maketheSWITCH","avatar_path":"/klZ9hebmc8biG1RC4WmzNFnciJN.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"While ‘Frozen 2’ isn’t as strong a film as I had hoped it would be, I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a disappointment. It’s still incredibly entertaining and I found myself engaged throughout. These films do have an undeniable charm, and outside of the now-completed ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ trilogy, ‘Moana’ and Laika’s ‘Missing Link’, these are the only major American animated films attempting the use the form to create a cinematic experience. It is a pity that the story never finds its feet; a combination of this level of craft and a real ripper of a yarn would have made this a slam-dunk. As it stands though, the magic of the ‘Frozen’ franchise is still there - dimmed, but there nonetheless.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-frozen-2-elsa-and-anna-return-with-the-magic-mostly-intact","created_at":"2019-11-25T04:02:15.441Z","id":"5ddb52473faba00013ff93b2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:29.338Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5ddb52473faba00013ff93b2"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nAs you should know by now, I enjoyed Frozen more than I expected. Therefore, I was genuinely excited about its six-year sequel. It’s one of the few movies in 2019 to which I went in 99% blind. I didn’t watch a single trailer, I barely saw any images or small clips, and I didn’t know anything about where the story was going. So, with my expectations moderately high, how did it perform? Very, very well. I’m going to write it straight away: I enjoy this sequel more than the original. For one simple reason: it possesses a more emotionally complex narrative, one which I think the target audience (basically kids) won’t even fully understand.\r\n\r\nIt’s really hard to create an animated flick with a story that works for both adults and children. The best of the best are the ones that are able to almost tell two different narratives: one simpler for kids with basic life lessons, and another for adults with more profound themes. Frozen II doesn’t reach this last level, but its layered screenplay allows for an exploration of Elsa’s powers that I genuinely didn’t expect. However, there’s an evident downside to the extreme focus on Elsa’s journey… The other characters are put aside with irrelevant subplots that only stretch the runtime a bit too much, and unfortunately, reach a certain point where out-of-character actions occur.\r\n\r\nThere’s even a period of time where a particular character simply vanishes from the story because Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck couldn’t figure out what to do with it during the last act. Despite the subplots not being impactful or not being able to further develop its characters, I can’t deny some sequences are entertaining and funny as hell. Olaf is the absolute MVP of the film, and just like in the original, he doesn’t exactly have an arc. Nevertheless, he has one of the most hilarious sequences of the year. I cried from so much laughter. His song and a couple of scenes where Josh Gad goes all out are some of the funniest of the whole movie.\r\n\r\nThe voice cast is once again perfect. Anna, Kristoff, and Sven are sort of along for the ride, with the trio only doing something useful in the last 15-20 minutes. Elsa is the real star of the show. From the opening shot to the last, it’s all about her, and her powers’ origin. It might get too convoluted for kids, but despite a few minor missteps, it’s an extremely well-developed screenplay. With a remarkable build-up and some truly amazing songs, Elsa goes through several action moments where she showcases all that her magic can do. And it’s visually mind-blowing. Like in the first film, the animation quality is extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThey really put 200% effort into Elsa’s magic sequences. From her running against a tide of waves to fighting against the four elements (water, fire, earth, and air), there are imaginative and incredibly entertaining scenes, which give the movie a level of entertainment superior to its predecessor. Put this together with the wonderful, powerful score, and you get a pretty epic film, scale-wise. I mean, Into the Unknown is not going to reach Let It Go’s level of worldwide craziness, but it’s a phenomenal song. It’s even better hearing it while watching the actual scene play out. Both this one and Show Yourself have a build-up worthy of sending chills down your spine.\r\n\r\nAll Is Found is also a memorable lullaby that a lot of parents are going to sing for their kids. When I Am Older is Olaf’s hilarious musical moment that left me laughing throughout its entire run. I love Frozen II’s score, more than the original’s. That’s something I genuinely wasn’t expecting at all. Looking back, I now think the first installment doesn’t even have enough significant songs. This sequel has tons of songs that are either extremely important for the characters or funny parodies. All are very captivating, catchy, and emotionally resonant. My advice: please, don’t listen to the soundtrack before watching the movie. Not only the titles and lyrics offer plot spoilers, but they ruin that “first experience” feeling. I got chills during a couple of them precisely because I watched besides only hearing them.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Frozen II compensates the six-year wait with a follow-up worthy of standing up to its original, which in my opinion, surpasses it. With an emotionally complex narrative, Elsa’s powers are explored and developed in a captivating, creative, fun, and entertaining way. Disney really put their best animators on this because the quality of animation has never been as visually impressive as this. It really feels like a magical film. Elsa’s magic demonstration plus the powerful, chill-inducing original score are two aspects that together provide some truly epic moments. However, Olaf is the MVP with a lot more screentime than in the original, and with a couple of the most hilarious scenes of the year. It’s a shame that the focus on Elsa’s arc pushed every other character aside, making them feel useless and with no exciting or impactful subplot. Runtime feels a bit stretched due to their side adventures, and exposition is pretty heavy throughout the entire duration. In the end, it’s still a contender for Best Animated Feature Film of 2019.\r\n\r\nRating: B+","created_at":"2019-11-26T09:09:18.407Z","id":"5ddcebbea80673001212bb00","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:29.381Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5ddcebbea80673001212bb00"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Better than the first film which I found lackluster in almost every area outside the animation, this one had a stronger story and character development and while I can't say there was one highly memorable song, it did flow a bit better in the sequel. **3.75/5**","created_at":"2020-02-29T21:01:29.105Z","id":"5e5ad12966ae4d001984cafb","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:34.598Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5e5ad12966ae4d001984cafb"},{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","author_details":{"name":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","username":"screenzealots","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/70d4177132896d293b72f4c595521141.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"Making a quality sequel can be tough, and even moreso when it’s a follow-up to a beloved modern classic. “Frozen II” has huge shoes to fill from the outset, and this second installment of the Disney animated tale of two sisters is a mostly unsuccessful adventure. Even the dazzling animation can’t make up for what’s lacking, including the absence of an instant hit song (nothing here even comes close to the brilliance of “Let It Go”), dry voice performances, and a mediocre story.\r\n\r\nWhen ice queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) begins hearing a strange voice calling her, she and sister Anna (Kristen Bell), Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) and reindeer Sven set out on a perilous journey to discover why Elsa was born with magical powers. It’s a surprisingly dark adventure that, despite beautiful set pieces, is generic. The plot is confusing yet somehow predictable, and everything is Disney-fied and wrapped up with a nice little bow by the final credits.\r\n\r\nMost disappointing are the bland songs (by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez). There isn’t one number that stands out. It’s a particularly huge letdown after the timeless toe-tappers of “Frozen.”\r\n\r\nThe movie feels like it’s made more for adults than kids, and there are some scary moments (like Olaf wandering through a deep, dark forest and flashbacks to the death of Anna and Elsa’s parents) that may frighten a few children. The idea of an action-adventure animated film with two strong female leads is commendable, but the potential to be something special instead of merely adequate is frittered away.\r\n\r\nWhile the magic doesn’t reach the highs of the first film, “Frozen II” is beautifully animated and visually impressive enough to recommend only to those who love animation as an art form. Everyone else would be smart to skip it.","created_at":"2020-03-27T01:45:02.694Z","id":"5e7d5a9e6c74b94ca5cac987","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:35.814Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5e7d5a9e6c74b94ca5cac987"},{"author":"tmdb92312096","author_details":{"name":"","username":"tmdb92312096","avatar_path":null,"rating":4.0},"content":"Exactly what one can expect from a Disney princess movie.","created_at":"2020-07-31T03:17:20.532Z","id":"5f238d40eea34d00373953a3","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:41.853Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f238d40eea34d00373953a3"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"Away from the <em>'Toy Story'</em> franchise - Disney's greatest sequel to date? I believe so.\r\n\r\n<em>'Frozen II'</em> is quality. I'd argue <em>'Frozen'</em> is the better film, but this 2019 production is terrific. It isn't as funny (though still has its moments) as it is a more darker, deeper story. Considering this premise only really exists in this film, it is impressive how well it comes out and pays off. The score is improved, though the musical numbers aren't quite as memorable as 2013's.\r\n\r\nAll the cast reprise their original roles and are again very good; props to Idina Menzel (Elsa) and Kristen Bell (Anna). Josh Gad remains very amusing as Olaf, there's one recap scene in particular that stands out.\r\n\r\nEntertaining, once more.

me.","created_at":"2020-08-31T17:30:19.739Z","id":"5f4d33abfea0d700343bfbfa","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:43.765Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f4d33abfea0d700343bfbfa"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":7},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1141232,"title":"Frozen

All the toys look brilliant, as does the world itself - I love the feel of it. The music is very good, Randy Newman does a nice job - \"You've Got a Friend in Me\" is a cracker.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks leads a strong cast. Hanks plays Woody, to fantastic effect. He is the best part of this film. Tim Allen is great, too, as Buzz Lightyear. Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head), Wallace Shawn (Rex) and John Ratzenberger (Hamm) also bring fun.\r\n\r\nEverything else is just as terrific: the humour, the pacing, the plot - I enjoy it all. There are probably some flaws in parts, namely Buzz's supposed unawareness, but nothing impacts the viewing experience.

I do recall, however, being especially fickle - the favourite one day was never likely to reign long before being supplanted by another. That's the case here for cowboy \"Woody\". He is the favourite of owner \"Andy\" amongst, it has to be said, rather a lot of different ones. Until, that is - one birthday, we meet Space Ranger \"Buzz Lightyear\". He's actually quite an affable chap, but the green eyed monster is now in charge and \"Woody\" tries to relegate his successor down the side of the bed. That goes wrong and, accidentally, out of the window he goes. The other toys are horrified, leaving \"Woody\" with no option but to get over his laser envy, rescue his new rival and repatriate him before the whole family move to a new home! What now ensues are some fun escapades, near misses and they fall into the hands of another young boy who really does want to blast \"Buzz\" into space. The vocal talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are enthusiastic and entertaining, those of Don Rickles (\"Mr. Potato Head\") sometimes a little nearer the bone for the grown ups and they are all helped along by a good soundtrack and a wittily written script offering us plenty of scenarios that draw the viewer (of whatever age) into this simple, pretty timeless story. It's interesting, for 1995, to note the wide variety of toys this young boy has, too - no gender stereotyping, which is quite refreshing. This is quickly paced and enjoyable animation that touches on the values of trust, companionship and team spirt - as well as the demerits of envy and selfishness - and I really enjoyed it.","created_at":"2022-06-15T14:24:10.203Z","id":"62a9eb8a22af3e52141eb12d","updated_at":"2022-06-15T14:24:10.203Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62a9eb8a22af3e52141eb12d"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1438466,"title":"Toy Story","original_title":"Toy Story","plot_overview":"Led by Woody, Andy's toys live happily in his room until Andy's birthday brings Buzz Lightyear onto the scene.

Chris McKay demonstrates all of his undeniable talent behind the camera, delivering brilliantly directed action scenes featuring excellent camera work, a chill-inducing score, and exceptional VFX - the Whitespikes look stunningly scary. Zach Dean doesn't avoid the formulas and cliches of the genre, offering a generic story with no real surprises but still possessing remarkable character work. Chris Pratt is great as the protagonist, but Yvonne Strahovski is on a whole other level, delivering one of her best performances ever in a feature film. With an overextended runtime, the last act is mostly unnecessary and less exciting, ultimately making the ending a tad underwhelming compared to the epic conclusion of the second act. I wouldn't be surprised if it gains a cult following, though. Tremendous replay value. Highly recommend it.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2021-07-06T17:35:20.721Z","id":"60e4945827ff990074dea224","updated_at":"2021-07-06T17:35:20.721Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60e4945827ff990074dea224"},{"author":"Kamurai","author_details":{"name":"Kamurai","username":"Kamurai","avatar_path":"/sKeC7qZLAKreuwxH4x6U3mN7Aa8.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Great watch, will likely watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nIt's usually a good sign when the worst part of a time travel movie is the time travel.\r\n\r\nI could probably make an hour long video on the time travel in this movie, especially compared to \"Looper\", but I'll forego that enough to say that it's well leveraged for the purposes of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe \"White Spikes\" are amazingly well put together, though I think projectile spikes are an odd biological evolution.\r\n\r\nThe story is far from perfect, but the cast, the acting, the situation, and especially the action are all executed wonderfully with a high production value to back it up.","created_at":"2021-07-11T19:57:00.010Z","id":"60eb4d0cf9a3fb00291d7e50","updated_at":"2021-07-11T19:57:00.010Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60eb4d0cf9a3fb00291d7e50"},{"author":"polkabike","author_details":{"name":"","username":"polkabike","avatar_path":null,"rating":null},"content":"This thing doesn't just have regular plot holes or logical inconsistencies, it has scene hole, moment to moment holes, blink and you'll miss it holes.

The film's premise lends to some confusion with trying to change timelines, leading to moments of disjointed logic and confusing plot points. But let me be honest, if you don't take the science seriously, you will enjoy the movie. The aliens are super creepy and overwhelming. Transporting soldiers to the future to help try to overcome a failing war for survival provides a fresh take on the alien battle trope. I enjoyed the parts of the movie that took place in the future where the risk and danger were higher than the present-day parts that were more focused on exposition. Because The Tomorrow War was released straight to streaming, I had low expectations that were undeniably exceeded. I will be back to watch this one again.","created_at":"2022-08-19T23:03:34.529Z","id":"630016c633a376007f86c70d","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:16:39.786Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630016c633a376007f86c70d"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":5}},{"id":1583797,"title":"The Tomorrow War","original_title":"The Tomorrow War","plot_overview":"The world is stunned when a group of time travelers arrive from the year 2051 to deliver an urgent message: Thirty years in the future, mankind is losing a global war against a deadly alien species.

J. Perry's first feature film - the former stuntman impresses in such a way that he could easily become a well-recognized director within the action genre.\r\n\r\nIt's not a bad plan for a weekend watch with family and friends.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-","created_at":"2022-08-13T12:45:39.892Z","id":"62f79cf3724de1007a011167","updated_at":"2022-08-13T12:45:39.972Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62f79cf3724de1007a011167"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**Overall : Day Shift is not without flaws but is a blast from start to finish with great action and fun characters.**\r\n\r\nDid not expect to enjoy this as much as I did! Day Shift brings a fresh new vibe to the vampire hunter genre, with most of the movie taking place in the bright sunny suburbs of LA. The action and fight sequences near John Wick-level choreography (which is not surprising since Chad Stahelski is involved) and the world built by Day Shift is intriguing and worth further exploration in future films. Jamie Foxx and Dave Franco have fun buddy cop chemistry, and some of the other characters might not be well developed but are still entertaining. I would love to see more from this franchise.","created_at":"2022-08-19T22:58:49.147Z","id":"630015a91c6aa700825f82a8","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:09:25.302Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630015a91c6aa700825f82a8"},{"author":"MovieGuys","author_details":{"name":"","username":"MovieGuys","avatar_path":null,"rating":4.0},"content":"A cliche wrapped up in cliche.

It's good weekend movie or late night flick.  It's not terribly deep but it has good special effects and good quality acting.  The action scenes, when there needs to be action, are good.  There is a good flow from scene to scene which staves off that dreaded \"grade B film\" feel.  \r\n\r\nThe comedy is good and not overly done or cheesy.  I liked the sector chief, he was funny for being the grimey-boss.  And Snoop Dogg was okay in the same laid back way he is. I still believe he fit the role of Jimmy Bones a lot better; though that movie was definitely for the $5 bin at Walmart.  I believe Snoop would do very well as a Master Vamp or boss-guy-sitting-in-the chair type figure.  As long as he doesn't have to emote.  He does very well in line delivery which makes great comedy if you know how to write for him. \r\n\r\nAll the actors did well in their roles.  The villaness was good in her role, very arrogant & dispicable (nice on the eyes).  The two vamp-killing brothers were both funny and performed great in their action scenes.  And the speical effects, car chase scenes, and both the Home invasion and Nest scenes were top notch. The studio got their moneies worth when they hired the stuntman company.   \r\n  \r\nI do think they went a little hard with the \"wimpy\" sidekick thing.  I didn't expect what happened to Franco's character to happen.  I thought maybe he'd get his act togther when the circumstances got intense, but the writers took him in another direction that suprisingly (though not terribly original) made sense with the story.  \r\nAnd I'm not sure WHY, but I keep getting Dave Franco and Zac Efron confused for one another...? (maybe it's the eyebrows)  Franco has been in a number of teen movies and blockbusters...sorta kinda.  I liked the _Fright Night_ re-make, _Neighbors 1 & 2_,(despite Seth Rogan being poison since the Santa Inc. debacle) and the _Now You See Me 1 & 2_ movies.  He's not terrible.  He did well for his character (and props to his stuntman) in this movie. \r\n\r\nAs I said before, this is a good vampire movie.  It's not exactly _Fright Night_, or _30 Days of Night_, but definitely holds its own.

They are looking to please the American government to gain some favour in return. However, some of them will surprise us with some good intentions and actions.It’s an exciting movie, spectacular in its genre and filled with dark humour and great character. So let’s dive into the story and some insights.\r\n\r\n**The Suicide Squad – The Story**\r\nThe American government organises a secret mission to take control of “Project Starfish” in the South American island of Corto Maltese. However, a recent coup overthrew the friendly American government and, the task forces created by intelligence officer Amanda Waller needs to destroy the laboratory of the secret experiment, Jötunheim. Colonel Rick Flag leads the first team that tries to enter the Corto Maltese’s beach. At the same time, the second team leader is Bloodsport, an assassin who accepted the mission under the blackmail of the American authorities. Both teams will have to strive and survive to accomplish the critical goal.\r\n\r\nOur heroes, or villains, needs to save the world from “Starro The Conqueror”, a dangerous weapon in the hands of the not trustable Corto Maltese’s government. But also prevent a tremendous international scandal that will destroy America’s reputation in the world.\r\n\r\nWill our team succeed with their mission?\r\nWhat will be the price to pay?\r\nAnd what is the difference between a not trustable regime and one which conspires against the world for its interests? \r\n\r\nFull Review and Analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/the-suicide-squad-2021-movie-review-and-analysis/","created_at":"2021-09-05T10:09:34.228Z","id":"6134975e64f71600629ffb82","updated_at":"2021-09-05T10:09:34.228Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6134975e64f71600629ffb82"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/the-suicide-squad-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"The Suicide Squad is everything its predecessor should have been, boasting everything a Suicide Squad film deserves. Proper rated-R content with extremely gory, bloody action sequences, which are impressively shot and choreographed through long takes, exceptional stunt work, and surprisingly outstanding VFX. \r\n\r\nWith the help of a witty soundtrack, James Gunn brings his dark humor to an expectedly hilarious level, though not all jokes land in a still generic screenplay filled with the usual cliches and formulaic developments. Nevertheless, the phenomenal cast elevates the overall picture with fantastic performances all-around, though Daniela Melchior's breakthrough performance is an absolute standout. \r\n\r\nEach squad member receives decent screentime to share their emotionally compelling backstories, transforming a superhero movie into a character-driven story instead of just a team of superpowered nobodies beating up a random CGI monster. \r\n\r\nGunn just can't seem to miss.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+","created_at":"2021-09-07T18:22:29.451Z","id":"6137ade5a217c000890ea0b8","updated_at":"2021-09-07T18:22:29.451Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6137ade5a217c000890ea0b8"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"The Suicide Squad is an uproarious extravaganza filled with grotesque nom-noms, full-on naked dick shots, and John Cena in tighty-whities and it’s is the most fun you’ll have with an R-rated comic book film in a theater (or at home with HBO Max) since Deadpool.

It is over the top crazy, weird and outrageous. It is also incredibly gory. It is a super hero / bad guy comedy with emphasis on comedy. I was thinking comedy version of Kill Bill (for the gore and killing) with supers in it when I was watching it.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I enjoyed watching it though.\r\n\r\nThe movie makes absolutely no pretense of being taken seriously. The “heros” are outrageously wacky and so are most normal persons in the movie. The plot is just as wacky as the characters and this is a movie in which the normal ludicrous and illogical plot twists that the Hollywood hacks usually comes up with actually feels right for the movie.\r\n\r\nI got a bit of a what the f… moment at the beginning when the movie had but started and everything went to hell right away. That was before I had realized how much of a comedy this movie really was supposed to be. If there is a sane moment in this movie I missed it.\r\n\r\nIf there was one thing I didn’t like about the movie it was the liberal use of jumping back and forth. I hate this “24 hours earlier…” bullshit or any permutations thereof.\r\n\r\nI also really didn’t like the “It’s the evil US government conducting illegal evil experiments and we’re supposed to cover it up” story line. It just typical Hollywood overused crap.\r\n\r\nI did like the action though. As I wrote before it is ridiculously gory and very very comical. So is a lot of the dialog which of course is as crazy and weird as the rest of the movie. In any other movie as large shark with legs walking on land saying “yum yum” and then eating someone, repeatedly, would be just cringeworthy. In this movie it actually works.\r\n\r\nThe movie is 2 hours 12 minutes long and it really did not feel too long. It was 2+ hours of fun entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe post credit scene was a bit lame though. Not at the same level as the rest of the movie.","created_at":"2022-05-22T14:30:07.585Z","id":"628a48ef209f1812c6340271","updated_at":"2022-05-22T14:30:07.585Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/628a48ef209f1812c6340271"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"What a surprise, after hearing such great things about this film for the past year I finally decided to give it a watch and it did not disappoint. James Gunn is such a fantastically creative director, and it is shown in full force here. Gunn is able to give each character their own artistic flair that makes even the most ridiculous characters (Polka-Dot Man) memorable. The comedy is on point, like most Gunn films, but there is a more brutal style of humor that is distinctly different the MCU humor that he has pioneered, given the R rating. I was pleased with the fighting choreography, with many unique kills i.e, the Harley Quinn escape scene. The plot is nothing special, but that is really in the background to the characters relationships that build throughout the course of the film.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_","created_at":"2022-06-30T19:30:45.444Z","id":"62bdf9e597eab400967a6dcb","updated_at":"2022-07-15T15:18:03.432Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62bdf9e597eab400967a6dcb"},{"author":"Dean","author_details":{"name":"Dean","username":"Ditendra","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4172cb0f573872484d9c3a4aa13ce65c.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Movie is different in terms of the violence it handles, but I feel that it falls into many things previously seen. The beginning of this film is brutal but as the second act progresses it becomes a bit tedious and there is a lot of sentimentality that ends up overshadowing the violence. The special effects are good and the sound is good too, most of the performances are convincing. While I didn't think it was that funny, it has it's few moments, and the main cast of characters is also more likable.","created_at":"2022-08-31T18:00:26.710Z","id":"630fa1ba0231f20091be3163","updated_at":"2022-08-31T18:00:26.751Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630fa1ba0231f20091be3163"},{"author":"JPRetana","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPRetana","avatar_path":"/eYudFTVvIpCweDVQEl878whalTy.jpg","rating":1.0},"content":"The Suicide Squad is to Suicide Squad what McDowell's is to McDonald's. Suicide Squad had Deadshot, The Suicide Squad has Bloodsport. Suicide Squad had a computer generated anthropomorphic crocodile, The Suicide Squad has a computer generated anthropomorphic shark. Suicide Squad had a Latino character who could control CGI flames, The Suicide Squad has a Hispanic character who can control CGI rats. Et-fucking-cetera.\r\n\r\nThese minor differences only serve to emphasize that the only real difference between this movie and its predecessor is a definite article in the title. Even the quote-unquote new characters serve to preserve the status quo, as their introduction allows writer/director James Gunn to repeat David Ayer's formula from the first film: Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who is clearly a bigger sociopath than any member of the Suicide Squad, scrapes the bottom of the DC barrel for characters who go from feeling sorry for themselves to feeling sorry for each other.\r\n\r\nBut there is something that The Suicide Squad has that Suicide Squad doesn't: an odd habit of unnecessarily doubling down. Thus, we have Peacemaker, who is interchangeable with Bloodsport does. Or Weasel, a humanoid weasel who is interchangeable with Pete Davidson, a weasely human (Davidson is possibly the only person more annoying than Margot Robbie; thankfully, his character gets his face shot off early on, which actually makes Davidson less grotesque to look at than usual).","created_at":"2022-09-03T16:46:19.270Z","id":"631384dbc048a9008fe99028","updated_at":"2022-09-03T16:46:19.454Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/631384dbc048a9008fe99028"},{"author":"badelf","author_details":{"name":"","username":"badelf","avatar_path":null,"rating":5.0},"content":"I certainly could have tolerated a LOT more comedic lines.

Downey Jr. comes across largely central, it is still a good mix and IMHO the best scenes in the movie involve the generated Hulk character.\r\n\r\nWith that kind of successful melding of characters, Hollywood-scale egos and even computer generated characters; you have to give it up to the writers and director to make this the successful film that it is.","created_at":"2012-06-05T23:00:24.000Z","id":"4fce8f8819c29523880000de","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:15.364Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/4fce8f8819c29523880000de"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"**A long format review from 2012**\r\n\r\nMy new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;\r\n\r\n1. The Avengers\r\n2. Iron Man\r\n3. Thor\r\n4. Captain America\r\n5. Iron Man 2\r\n6. The Incredible Hulk\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it’s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us… So worth it.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. \r\n\r\nIn terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau’s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I’ve ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor’s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn’t a Thor movie, so we don’t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year’s Thor 2, it is very possible we’ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki’s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won’t spoil it by telling you who they’re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn’t really drive the story at all.\r\n\r\nI feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers doesn’t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn’t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!\r\n\r\n90%\r\n\r\n-Gimly","created_at":"2017-10-27T02:47:35.267Z","id":"59f29e47c3a3687126003ccd","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:02.159Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/59f29e47c3a3687126003ccd"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":null},"content":"After the recent disappointments from Marvel, notably Thor and the abysmal second instalment of Ghost Rider, this was a pleasant experience.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are dazzling, the plot is acceptable and the heroes are not making total idiots out of themselves just because the director wanted some “depth” to their characters. Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.\r\n\r\nI’ve always liked Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he’s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the “puny god” scene (if you haven’t seen the film yet you’ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).\r\n\r\nI have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then I’m Scandinavian so…\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was a great film.

It stars Robert Downey Junior, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddlestone, Clark Gregg, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.\r\n\r\nAsgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.\r\n\r\nI have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.\r\n\r\nFlaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10","created_at":"2019-08-04T12:28:04.980Z","id":"5d46cf540f2fbd7864efbe30","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:25.149Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d46cf540f2fbd7864efbe30"},{"author":"Justin Lopez","author_details":{"name":"Justin Lopez","username":"ShawnSmith","avatar_path":"/5zwo9rNpYTQxPFxXJeYHxEw86SC.jpg","rating":null},"content":"The Avengers is a dream movie come true for superhero fans with its group of extremely talented actors and epic champions, to create an action- packed movie with hilarious banter laced in between scenes.

Here, he plays the down on his luck \"Harper\" - a former American Special Forces operative - who joins up with some former colleagues on an highly paid mission in Germany under the aegis of Kiefer Sutherland (\"Rusty\"). Of course it all goes wrong and we now have to endure the usual run-of-the-mill cat and mouse antics as he tries to get home safely and deal with his betrayer. It's not that it's a shocker, this - it's just that it is all so join-the-dots. It is in no way original; the plot is terribly predictable with the baddie's identity written pretty large right from the start and though entertaining enough, all the action scenes have such a disappointing inevitability about them. It takes quite a while to build up a head of steam, which doesn't really help it either as the whole thing could easily condense down into a decent fifty minute action thriller. It's a competent made for telly movie that I doubt even it's writers can remember now.","created_at":"2022-06-02T14:43:31.374Z","id":"6298cc937e12f02c81543367","updated_at":"2022-06-02T14:43:31.374Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6298cc937e12f02c81543367"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3}},{"id":1588061,"title":"The Contractor","original_title":"The Contractor","plot_overview":"After being involuntarily discharged from the U.S. Special Forces, James Harper decides to support his family by joining a private contracting organization alongside his best friend and under the command of a fellow veteran.

always very nervous when a film's advertising campaign leads extensively on the director and not on the acting... To be honest, here, I really couldn't quite see what the fuss was about on either front. A pretty monosyllabic \"OJ\" (Daniel Kaluuya) lives with his feisty sister \"Emerald\" (Keke Palmer) on a remote stud farm where they provide horses for the movies. When strange things start going bump in the night, and the horses start behaving oddly, then disappearing all together - they are bemused. Off to town they go where they meet local geek \"Torres\" (Brandon Perea) who is full to the brim with alien conspiracy theories and who comes and installs some CCTV for them. What now ensues is a quirky, rather poorly paced sci-fi caper that takes far too long to get going and then when it does, well it sort of rumbles along with loads of pretty repetitive photography, minimalist dialogue and an ending that made me chuckle - and I am not sure that was Jordan Peele's intention. The plot reminded me of something from the \"Outer Limits\" from the 1960s! There is certainly some lovely scenery to be admired in this California valley but all in all I was totally underwhelmed by this film, the best bits I felt, were seen in the trail.","created_at":"2022-08-15T09:42:11.700Z","id":"62fa14f31cac8c007a30a2c8","updated_at":"2022-08-15T09:42:11.774Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62fa14f31cac8c007a30a2c8"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/nope-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Nope contains extraordinarily immersive technical elements, but the thematic focus raises narrative issues.\r\n\r\nJordan Peele takes full advantage of Hoyte van Hoytema's phenomenal cinematography and Michael Abels' memorable score to create a spectacle worthy of the big screen, but it's the sound production that really elevates the movie to that level.\r\n\r\nDaniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Steven Yeun are exceptional, but the latter is tied to an extremely thematic storyline - immensely rich - with little to no impact on the main plot, leaving countless questions unanswered and a divided audience while still affecting the overall pacing.\r\n\r\nHumor is surprisingly effective, and the moments of suspense and tension deliver what viewers most desire.

Nothing is typical of anything he does. Even knowing it is an alien movie, he keeps things fresh with surprising twists and eerie tension. Unlike anything I have seen before—there is excellent symbolism through the flashback sequences. I also enjoyed the developing relationship between the main two characters. My only complaint is that the horror and dread so palpable at the beginning fades completely about two-thirds into the film.","created_at":"2022-08-19T23:13:04.321Z","id":"630019001da7a600a4cdba4c","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:17:13.249Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630019001da7a600a4cdba4c"},{"author":"MovieGuys","author_details":{"name":"","username":"MovieGuys","avatar_path":null,"rating":4.0},"content":"They said it and you wont hear me disagreeing with it. Did I find it entertaining? \"nope\". Did  I feel the story was cohesive and comprehensible, with a clear contextual message? \"nope\". Were characterisations relatable and relevant? \"Sort of\". \r\n\r\nNope's characterisations are moderately relatable but somehow, also seem to appear oddly misconstrued. The mostly monosyllabic cowboy character, for example, only adds to the sense of ambiguity (perhaps that's the idea).To my mind however, this ploy, if that's what it is, stifles development, of the already ambiguous, story line. The sister, his complete antithesis, is superficially verbose but seems equally, to lack any depth of self awareness.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can say conclusively about Nope, is the visuals are  compelling, complex and, at times, almost intricate. This film certainly scores a A+ in this regard. \r\n\r\nThat said, so much else is lacking, in particular a clearly articulated narrative, that it failed to resonate, with me. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I found Nope a frustrating, dissatisfying watch.

'Get Out' shifted the paradigm for horror movies, taking a genre which has historically been associated with a temporary experience of thrill and adrenaline, to being social commentaries on society and raising some deeper questions about ourselves in the process of watching his stories unfold.\r\n\r\nNope is no exception, and in fact it can be argued that it attempts to combine story, metaphor and meaning in a more ambitious way than his previous outings. Taking the central theme of 'spectacle', Peele beautifully illustrates its dangers and how we as a society are so obsessed with the spotlight to our own detriment (and even int he worst cases, eventual demise). Choosing a more science fiction approach this time around, Peele does a great job of story telling, and often subvert's out expectations time and time again in the process. Aside from the film's deeper meaning, some of the other highlights come in the form of the cinematography and performances from the central characters (mostly notably, OJ, Emerald and Angel). Peele has managed to create some complex characters which are highly relatable, and the chemistry between the actors is something which will be a lasting memory for me.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do feel that the film does sacrifice plot and narrative in its relentless effort to hammer in the metaphor of the central theme - 'Spectacle'. While I did enjoy each story (OJ and the Animal Alien and Gordie and Jupe), I had a hard time understanding the relationship they had with each other from a narrative point of view. It often felt like two stories could have been played out better without the interference of the other. Other than that I did have some questions around OJ's motivations to tame / kill this animal, the legitimacy of the final impossible shot, the nature and behaviour the animal, and how / if OJ survived (or was this open for interpretation?). The ending of the film also was a slight let down with the death of the animal not being all that grand. This however could also be tied into the overall message of 'Spectacle' as the finale is often not worth the what we expect it to be.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think Nope is a very good movie which will probably get better with a few re-watches to fully appreciate what Peele was trying to tell us.","created_at":"2022-09-07T07:26:25.444Z","id":"631847a18ddc34007a616832","updated_at":"2022-09-08T15:30:52.067Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/631847a18ddc34007a616832"},{"author":"[robbie grawey]","author_details":{"name":"[robbie grawey]","username":"robbiegrawey","avatar_path":"/qB7lELWBr2iNbKu3eYBI2bxzJ7I.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"My first Jordan Peele film!\r\nSuch a rich text and an incredibly well-crafted piece of filmmaking.

I thought the acting and writing were fine, and the title was a subtle selection. The odd subplot of the incident with Gordy the monkey reminded me of the movie Magnolia for some reason. I wonder if that film was any kind of an influence on Jordan Peele’s storytelling style?\r\n\r\nThe entity in this movie is rather quirky and odd as we learn how it operates and its likes and dislikes. I will say no more than that because learning about it is part of the fun, though I am sure it made it too slow moving for thriller fans. It won’t be a favorite of mine, but it makes the short list of horror movies I have watched and liked just

His trademark fast-forward, HFR (high frame rate) type of action doesn't appeal to many viewers, and his nonlinear narrative structure is often more confusing than captivating. At least, these are the common complaints across his filmography. While I acknowledge that these attributes don't always work, I'm actually quite a fan of his filmmaking techniques. From his more recent work on Aladdin and The Gentlemen to his take on classic characters such as Sherlock Holmes and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, I genuinely enjoy Ritchie's risky, divisive approach on the best way to tell a story.\r\n\r\nGoing in completely blind to Wrath of Man, I honestly didn't have a good feeling. I expected a generic, hollow, forgettable action flick with a main actor who everyone has seen countless times in this genre. I just hoped it would be entertaining enough for me to have a decent couple of hours in front of the TV. Well, this movie might be 2021's best surprise to date! If Zack Snyder (Zack Snyder’s Justice League) is often criticized for his excessive use of slow-motion, Ritchie receives the exact same complaints but regarding his high-speed action scenes. This time, the latter leaves his well-known characteristics aside and proves that he's not a one-trick filmmaker.\r\n\r\nImpressively long, uncut takes - some reach the three-minute mark - help create a tremendously tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime. Every scene is set up with patience and precise timing, making every single tiny movement from the camera and actors capture the audience's attention. Christopher Benstead's score is one of those examples that I will start giving people when they ask about impactful music in film. The heavy cello notes are incredibly ominous, establishing the mood of the whole environment in a way that will leave no viewer indifferent. Some of you might read the following as a critique, but the build-ups for each action scene steal the spotlight from the latter.\r\n\r\nWith that said, the shootouts and overall action are entertaining and well-filmed, which I believe will please a vast majority of spectators. Jason Statham (The Meg, Hobbs & Shaw) delivers a one-dimensional performance that would feel disappointing in any other movie, but it works for this protagonist. The main character is supposed to be mysterious and capable of anything, so it's only logical that he hides every ounce of emotion - even though it negatively affects a couple of dialogues. Furthermore, it's Jason Statham… moviegoers go see his films for his action skills, not his acting chops. When it comes to fire a gun or beat someone up, there are not that many actors who can do so as convincing as him.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, Ritchie didn't let go of his favorite narrative structure. Nonlinear storytelling is extremely difficult to pull off perfectly due to how easily it becomes confusing or messy. Fortunately, Wrath of Man features several storylines converging all in a single moment, which quickly demonstrates what the screenwriters plan to do. A mysteriously compelling first half transitions to a more predictable, formulaic second part where one of the storylines feels both tacked on and uninteresting. The secondary characters lack any sort of arc or random development, with the focus going completely into the protagonist's mission, whatever that may be.\r\n\r\nWrath of Man isn't a groundbreaking, mind-blowing, or even innovative action movie, but it's still one of the biggest, best surprises of the year. While it's true that Guy Ritchie still follows the genre formulas of success, he shocks everyone by leaving his trademark filmmaking techniques aside, delivering an incredibly tense film packed with suspenseful, one-take build-ups to energetic, riveting action sequences. Jason Statham's one-dimensional display works well enough for a mysteriously captivating protagonist who the viewers can easily root for once his true goal is revealed. Christopher Benstead's score tremendously elevates the entire movie, establishing an extremely gripping atmosphere. The nonlinear storytelling features parallel narratives that are not all interesting or necessary, ending with an ironically abrupt last scene, contradicting the overall steady pacing. In the end, it's a solid recommendation to watch in theaters if possible.\r\n\r\nRating: B+","created_at":"2021-05-06T21:57:02.367Z","id":"6094662e9f0e19007a5c4ce1","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:55.322Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6094662e9f0e19007a5c4ce1"},{"author":"BudLightYear","author_details":{"name":"","username":"BudLightYear","avatar_path":null,"rating":6.0},"content":"Huge Jason Statham fan. But despite the trailer, this movie was far from his greatest. He's his usual cool self, but the story is weak and performance from Josh Hartnett is downright embarrassing, to say the least. Holt McCallany is decent, but in general the characters come off as two-dimensional. You really don't care about them. I panicked when I saw Jeffrey Donovan, because his appearance is seldom that impressive. He was okay though, far from the one to blame for this B-movie. It's not bad, but certainly not a masterpiece either.","created_at":"2021-05-29T17:17:20.432Z","id":"60b277206dea3a00588fd4d9","updated_at":"2021-06-23T17:19:34.889Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60b277206dea3a00588fd4d9"},{"author":"Peter McGinn","author_details":{"name":"Peter McGinn","username":"narrator56","avatar_path":"/tVbrLJzA2RwRlE7dJLJG54UsAkq.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Viewers who like action films with plenty of violence for the sake of having violence will love this movie. I can’t deny that the action grabs you by the throat and moves you along with it. Sometimes, however, it felt to me like instead of a storyboard they worked from a murderboard: “Okay, how many do we lose in this scene?”  Once again I am reminded of Hitchcock. Suspense is not a bomb going off; suspense is not knowing when or if it will explode.\r\n\r\nThey took a bit of trouble to make the plot seem more intricate than it was: having maybe three flashbacks do the work of one, for example. Some of that layering of plot could have been diverted to character building and development. Only our hero is given motivation and a back story, and there are even gaps in that.\r\n\r\nBut it should be remembered that these observations are by, and for, someone who is not a fan of action films. If you are a fan, then nothing I have written here should deter you from watching Wrath of Man.","created_at":"2021-06-01T01:56:16.900Z","id":"60b593c0371097002ac52fb4","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:56.462Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60b593c0371097002ac52fb4"},{"author":"RADIO1'S MR.

Also, nice to see a director take his Disney dollars and return to making something original.\r\n\r\nIs it a great film? Not really. But, it's really well crafted, the story is interestingly told, and it rekindles the vibe that made Ritchie the UK's version of Tarantino when he first emerged. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint isn't necessarily about this film specifically but more it's \"type\" by which I mean it's yet another film about a guy with a secret badass background who goes on a revenge spree. John Wick, Taken, Nobody, The Equalizer, and so many others have done the same thing. Apparently bullets don't do permanent damage to lead characters? Seriously, with the damage he takes in this film he should have spent the runtime changing a colostomy bag and being wheeled to the TV to watch cartoons while drooling down his chest. But, again, that's not unique to this film. It's kinda the standard now days. I guess when so many films seem to have the intention of being a franchise a character's mortality only becomes an issue if the actor doesn't renew their contract. \r\n\r\nIf you don't mind this issue, it's a really fun film. I enjoyed it a lot. I'm just getting tired of invincible heroes in films.","created_at":"2021-08-13T12:51:36.072Z","id":"61166ad899d5c30046efdcfa","updated_at":"2021-08-13T22:15:40.559Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61166ad899d5c30046efdcfa"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"I am quite a fan of Jason Statham so I am perhaps a bit biased when it comes to movies he is in but, to me, this was a great action thriller. I very much like Statham playing the silent, mysterious tough guy role. He is perfect in this role.\r\n\r\nThe movie builds up somewhat slowly but it does not take very long before Statham shows that he is not an ordinary security guy when he takes down some wannabe robbers with nothing less than extreme efficiency. A very cool scene.\r\n\r\nOn one side I like that the movie takes some time to build up the suspense and reveal the plot. In articular why Statham is there in the first place. On the other side the way the movie does it irks me somewhat. There just to much flashbacks for my taste and some events we are forced to watch from no less than three different perspectives. Felt a bit like a filler to me. Still, Statham’s passed and presents weaves together in a story that, to me, is quite good and not the everyday, run of the mill, revenge story. Quite well done actually.\r\n\r\nNot entirely surprising the movie builds up to a big showdown in the end. I very much liked it. Lots of action although I would have liked that they let a few more of the good guys actually survive. The death count on both sides was somewhat excessive.\r\n\r\nThe ending was satisfactory although from a point in the showdown, about twenty or minutes from the end, it was rather predictable.\r\n\r\nThe reason this movie gets four and a half (or 9 out of 10) stars instead of the full five out of five is only because of the flash backs which. Some of them contributed to the movie but some of them actually bored me a bit.","created_at":"2021-12-31T11:09:54.638Z","id":"61cee502a802360041c7e86e","updated_at":"2021-12-31T11:09:54.638Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61cee502a802360041c7e86e"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":9},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1590821,"title":"Wrath of Man","original_title":"Wrath of Man","plot_overview":"A cold and mysterious new security guard for a Los Angeles cash truck company surprises his co-workers when he unleashes precision skills during a heist.

Unfortunately for him, he encounters the sleepy-head sloth \"Sid\" whom he rescues from a pair of rhinos, only to bitterly regret his kindness as this pesky mammal is soon getting on his nerves. Meantime, a pride of sabre-toothed tigers are plotting revenge on a human village whose hunting parties have taken their toll on their now dwindling numbers. Their target is a baby - but luckily it's mother manages to plunge it off a waterfall where, drenched, it is rescued by our two squabbling travellers. The tigers still haven't given up hope of securing their rather meagre lunch, and \"Diego\" - a sort of wily and menacing character is charged with luring the party to an ambush at \"half peak\" where their trap will be sprung.... This is all fairly predictable fayre, to be honest. You just know that the initial hostilities will all mellow and that teamwork, resilience and loyalty will prevail. It's not without it's humour though, and there are some fun animated action scenes that use well the surrounding snowy scenarios. Personally I found it better when it was just the beasties, the human angle was a little dull and didn't really add much. Some good scoring mixing modern with classical styles, a bit of fun ice skating and \"Diego\" did rather enjoyably remind me of \"Scar\" from the \"Lion King\" (1994). I saw it on my own at a cinema this morning which was a shame - it's a solid story with some reasonable characterisations and the animation is efficient rather than ground breaking. Certainly it is all just a bit too derivative, but 20 years on, it still has traction and I did rather enjoy it.","created_at":"2022-08-13T20:24:32.764Z","id":"62f80880a313b8007cf3b5d9","updated_at":"2022-08-13T20:24:32.821Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62f80880a313b8007cf3b5d9"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1176749,"title":"Ice Age","original_title":"Ice Age","plot_overview":"With the impending ice age almost upon them, a mismatched trio of prehistoric critters – Manny the woolly mammoth, Diego the saber-toothed tiger and Sid the giant sloth – find an orphaned infant and decide to return it to its human parents.

The two lead characters are out right stupid. Herman Munster played by Jeff Daniel Phillips loosing Lily Munster entire family fortune. Which is treated not as if it was a tragedy but more like like he left his phone at the Jim. This has less to do with Sheri Moon Zombie, and Jeff's acting chops and more to do with Rod Zombie's Direction. Top marks go to all supporting characters with special shout out to Daniel Roebuck, Richard Brake, and Cassandra Peterson. As they really where fun to watch.

This one brought together the tangled history behind a character with some significant flaws and also retains his brutality, which earns this its R rating.\r\n\r\nThis was initially a web series (like Constantine: City of Angels and Vixen) so not sure if there will be a follow-up, and perhaps something to be made an animated film rather than compiled from animated shorts.

The plot is pretty fascinating, even if it isn't as dark or in-depth as it could be.\r\n\r\nMing-Na Wen gives a more than acceptable performance in the lead role. Eddie Murphy, though, is definitely the most memorable voice from this. I don't love his character, who is a bit too cartoon-y and looks out of place, but Murphy is simply funny, in what certainly feels like a precursor to his role in the <em>'Shrek'</em> franchise. None of the other cast standout, yet still give what's required.\r\n\r\nAnimation-wise it's nice, while a few of the songs are catchy. I don't, as already alluded to with Murphy's Mushu, overly rate the character design. Aside from the aforementioned, I also don't like how Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) looks - he, at least to me, just looks angry all the time rather than terrifying or threatening.\r\n\r\nI do class this as a film worth watching for sure, the pacing helps keep things enjoyable.","created_at":"2020-07-02T18:11:30.272Z","id":"5efe2352a284eb003793d0ef","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:40.053Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5efe2352a284eb003793d0ef"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\n2020 brings us yet another Disney's live-action remake. After new versions of The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and many others, now comes the time for Mulan. Therefore, I decided to go back in time and relive one of the latest installments of the Disney Renaissance Era. As a kid, even though I was (and I still am) far from being someone impacted by the Chinese culture, I always enjoyed the movie for its story, characters, and of course, its memorable score. However, for some reason, it never became one of those Disney classics I revisit every year. This might very well be only my 5th time watching this film, which for someone born in the 90s like me, feels weirdly short.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the first time I watch Mulan since I was an innocent young teenager, so I was definitely intrigued to see if my overall opinion would change a lot or not. Well, enough of the suspense, I love it! I appreciate it a lot more than when I was a kid, without a single doubt. In fact, if I could only choose one movie to be remade in the live-action format, Mulan would be my ultimate choice, simply due to its epic and cinematic feel. Not trying to take away from the compelling story and incredible characters, but when it comes to live-action, Mulan has everything to deliver a chill-inducing visual spectacle. This film proves how 2D animation can feel so powerful and emotionally overwhelming.\r\n\r\nAs with every movie from the Disney Renaissance Era, the animation looks gorgeous. Dozens of jaw-dropping shots resemble the epic scope of Lord of the Rings. The action sequences are incredibly riveting and innovative, placing the main character in situations where she needs to act smart. Jerry Goldsmith's music plays a vital part in the narrative. Not only it develops characters in a meaningful way, but it helps the story move forward with fun and entertaining songs. Once again, the action set pieces are also elevated by this score, which offers a whole other cinematic layer. Technically, Mulan is one of Disney's best animated flicks ever.\r\n\r\nHowever, as usual, the two pillars of any film are what people end up saving in their hearts and memory: story and characters. With so many writers attached to screenplay credits, I'm genuinely surprised Mulan has such a well-written, well-structured, emotionally resonating narrative. Packed with culturally significant storylines, it's hard not to feel enthralled by Mulan's (Ming-Na Wen) arc. A daughter who goes to war by stealing her old father's spot, protecting him from certain death, while also trying to honor her family. A woman who wants to be more than just a wife to some man. Fighting against the menacing Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army, but also against condescending stereotypes and ancient society rules.\r\n\r\nMing-Na Wen gives Mulan a powerful voice worth remembering. After more than twenty years, her journey is still an inspiring tale not only to every woman and young girl on the planet, but to everyone who lays eyes on this movie. Captain Li Shang (BD Wong) also has his own arc of trying to prove himself worthy of being called Captain. Against all the odds, he still trains his troops and honors his own father. Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Yao (Harvey Fierstein), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo) are hilarious, but also essential to help save China from the enemy. Shan-Yu works perfectly as an intimidating presence, even though his motivations follow the generic villain formula.\r\n\r\nNow, prepare yourselves because my only issue with the film might be a hot take. I'm sure that as a kid, I loved Mushu and all of his jokes. He also has a compelling storyline in the same way as other characters. However, watching the film now, I can only hear Eddie Murphy perform a few jokes like a standup routine. When I listen to Mushu, I don't think \"oh, that's Mushu\". I think \"that's Eddie Murphy\". It's a remarkably somber, dark movie to match Disney's trademark humor, so the tone's balance must be perfect for it to work. Mushu might bring the necessary levity with a lighthearted joke here and there, but overall, he's the main reason why sometimes the film loses track of when to take things seriously and when to be funny.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Mulan is one of the most culturally significant animated classics that Disney possesses. Even after two decades, its story inspires every single person who sets eyes in this magnificent piece of cinema. Its emotionally compelling narrative is packed with epic action sequences elevated by a memorable score, which also helps develop characters and carry the story forward. The eponymous character's arc still resonates with many people today: a journey of proving one's self-worth, family, and breaking stereotypes. With a terrific voice cast, almost every character holds a captivating storyline with their own clear motivations. Visually, it has a cinematic feel that no other Disney animated flick owns. Tonally, the balance could be better. The tragic, somber, dark war is present throughout the whole runtime, and while some levity and humor are definitely welcome, some jokes stand out as unnecessary, and Eddie Murphy's Mushu is way too silly during certain moments. Having in mind the target audience, one can't complain too much. It's a little nitpick in an otherwise phenomenal movie, one that I recommend to every reader so that you can all be inspired by it like so many people all around the world.\r\n\r\nRating:

Yep - I'd guessed 80% of it 2 months ago.  \r\nIs it silly?  You bet. \r\n\r\nAre the humans essential? Nah, but we didnt come here for them.\r\nWe came to see Kong and Godzilla slug it out.  And we got that!  \r\n\r\nThe scenes with the Kaiju are well thought out and choreographed (can we say that for digital fights?).  And do they ever deck it out.  \r\nThe devastation you see on the poster gives away how much of Hong Kong gets destroyed (there will be extra land available for building now). \r\n\r\nThe movie is directed and paced well - the first half sets things up for the multiple confrontation between the Kaiju; and the second half lets loose.  \r\n\r\nNone of the actors are given much to do and most seem to sleepwalk through it, but Rebecca Hall is easily the best (she is always a delight to watch), Kyle Chandler channels Coach Taylor for a couple of scenes, Julian Dennison (from Hunt for the Wilderpeople) gets some good lines and Demian Bichir is having fun as the evil rich dude (never trust rich people...in movies or real life). \r\n\r\nThe sound design and score are both on point, but everything here subsides when the Kaiju are around.  The CGI is great - and like Peter Jackson's Kong, you actually feel for the great big monkey.  \r\n\r\nThis movie is some first class popcorn, needing to be enjoyed on the biggest screen you can find.","created_at":"2021-04-01T11:24:13.690Z","id":"6065ad5db84f94006f4b9363","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:53.842Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6065ad5db84f94006f4b9363"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Godzilla vs. Kong suffers from what other versus films such as Freddy vs. Jason or the Alien vs. Predator films also suffered from. These films put too much value in humans when the audience just wants to see more of the on-screen monsters they either paid hard money or chose to stream to see. That’s why if Legendary chooses to keep this franchise going they should do All Monsters Attack or something involving Monster Island next where humans can be spectators at best and monsters wreak havoc for up to two straight hours.

Max Borenstein and Eric Pearson manage to write an uncomplicated screenplay without absurd plot points or extremely dumb character decisions, which is all I ever asked for in this franchise, even if it carries tons of formulas and cliches. No one expects an Oscar-worthy script, but something that can serve as a companion piece to the massive battles between the Titans. Adam Wingard struggles to balance the unnecessary, irrelevant side stories that unfortunately affect the film's pacing and tone, but ultimately he's able to set up each fighting sequence nicely. Action-wise, it's the best entry of the saga, by far. From the genuinely impressive, eyegasmic CGI work to the exciting, adrenaline-pumping monster fights that will leave you at the edge of your seat, this movie is the definition of pure blockbuster entertainment. Extraordinary production value, as expected, and a perfect Junkie XL's score make this a clear recommendation.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2021-06-15T18:37:10.394Z","id":"60c8f35648333a002a3cabf1","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:56.920Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60c8f35648333a002a3cabf1"},{"author":"Rene","author_details":{"name":"Rene","username":"The_Bad_Critic","avatar_path":"/q3zcMPYz1m7sZ8jD4ol5m6gHBQI.png","rating":8.0},"content":"So after many years of flukes and alright and great movies over a decade we officially get a face off between the 2 and it kicked ass. buildings came down people died and these 2 fought a mechanical version. it is the end to a good red vs blue kinda movie.","created_at":"2021-07-08T19:25:09.413Z","id":"60e75115bcf8c9002f98eb38","updated_at":"2021-07-08T23:09:56.130Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60e75115bcf8c9002f98eb38"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"I have to admit that I expected not to like this movie. When Hollywood decides to pitch two characters, whether it’s superheroes or monsters, that are essentially good against each other it usually turns into crap. Take the absolutely abysmal Batman vs Superman for instance. Then we have Kong Skull Island which, while still being watchable, had a really lousy script.\r\n\r\nBut to my surprise I quite liked this movie. I really got worried when the movie started off with some nutcase activist that Hollywood likes to glorify. Then they had to kiss up to Communist News Network as well by giving them some product placement. Don’t use a real world news network in fiction movies please. Especially not a well known fake news and far left propaganda machine.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the end it all turned out nicely. The nutcase activist was really a nutcase and really really annoying but he still turned out to be on the side of the good guys.\r\n\r\nThe story was not altogether bad and although this story of the hollow earth is really far out fantasy more than anything else, even more than the idea of Kong and Godzilla themselves, I liked it. It was quite cool actually and it allowed for some nice special effects other than just Godzilla and Kong beating each other up and wrecking a few cities in the process.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of special effects. They are really why you watch these kind of movies. Sure a half decent story and passable acting helps but the special effects are the bulk of the enjoyment. For me the movie didn’t disappoint in this area.\r\n\r\nThey were overall very good and actually quite balanced. Well balanced considering the kind of movie. You cannot have a Godzilla movie without at least a couple of city blocks getting demolished after all. Having an actual wet navy battleship showing up I do ascribe to the usual Hollywood writer stupidity of course but for the rest it was really cool. I especially liked the hollow earth scenes and the strange landscape with all the weird creatures.\r\n\r\nWarning, spoiler ahead: The thing I really liked with the movie was that the writers didn’t go down the route of killing either Godzilla or Kong. Something I really feared and which would have reduced the movie to a rubbish rating as far as I am concerned. Instead they threw in Mechagodzilla which was quite cool albeit predictable at this point in the movie and one which united Godzilla and Kong. Also this weird, completely devoid of any (even fictional) science, link to Gidorah was quite a bit of a stretch.\r\n\r\nOverall, watching this movie was two hours well spent as far as I am concerned.","created_at":"2021-07-19T13:49:21.496Z","id":"60f582e1af58cb002f3abb74","updated_at":"2021-07-19T13:49:21.496Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60f582e1af58cb002f3abb74"},{"author":"itsogs","author_details":{"name":"","username":"itsogs","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1026aeda456e61335d036bbccb47d775.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"If you liked the movies with Kong and Godzilla, you will enjoy this, complete with CGI and monsters against humans.

It promises a battle of epic proportions, but doesn't have the balls to give us a winner. The late introduction of Mechagodzilla is meant to give the titular characters a common enemy, allowing them to put their differences – whatever these may be – aside and work together. They want to have their cake and eat it too.\r\n\r\nThe film tries to sell us on the idea that Earth is too small for two “alpha titans.” It doesn't occur to anyone that it might be too small for just one; then again, given that both Kong’s and Godzilla’s presence lacks weight, mass, volume, and depth, neither of them can be said to take up physical space on the planet (not to mention that most of the ‘real world’ surrounding them has been as unconvincingly rendered as they have).\r\n\r\nIt is, however, during an expedition to the so-called Hollow Earth that the VFX department really blows its CGI wad. There is no excess they won’t indulge in, and yet it’s not enough to hide the fact that Earth isn't the only hollow thing here – so is the script, which is unable to give us a single good reason why we should care about the skirmishes between a giant lizard and a giant gorilla.\r\n\r\nYou can't have two characters fight each other just because, no matter how ‘cool’ it might seem in theory; they must have a compelling motive, lest the audience loses interest in the outcome. This is such a basic concept that even the later, lesser Rocky installments understand it. But here, Godzilla and Kong just don't seem to like each other very much; even Tom and Jerry, who at least are natural enemies, have a better excuse for their enmity.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, 1) we don't know why a primate and a reptile would want to fight to the death; 2) the explanation the movie provides doesn’t make sense (I mean, Hollow Earth? Puh-lease!); 3) Kong and Godzilla are so phony-looking there is never any concern that they will hurt one another, however much they try; and 4) it's a foregone conclusion that neither is going to take a dive, needed as they are for the inevitable sequels. All things considered, why watch this movie when you can see Peter Griffin fight a giant chicken on YouTube?","created_at":"2022-08-28T22:49:18.753Z","id":"630bf0eecaa508007fdd42bb","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:38:13.748Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630bf0eecaa508007fdd42bb"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":11}},{"id":1150091,"title":"Godzilla

Mercenary with a mouth is back with the eagerly awaited arrival of “Deadpool 2”. The films sees the generally well-meaning but highly dysfunctional Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), back to taking out bad guys as a contract player but also managing his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin).  When an unexpected event sends his life into a freefall, Deadpool tries to find a new purpose with the help of his X-Men associates from the last film who attempt to recruit him into their organization.\nHis first mission is to defuse an angry and destructive young mutant named Russell (Julian Dennison), which takes an unexpected turn and lands them both in serious trouble.\n\nOne would think that would be enough to cause some major life changes for Deadpool but thanks to the arrival of Cable (Josh Brolin), a cyborg soldier from the future; things are about to get much more complicated and intense.\nUndaunted, Deadpool opts to form his own league of heroes and aside from Domino (Zazie Beetz); they seem to be as unlucky or dysfunctional as their leader which makes for some very hysterical consequences.\n\nWhat follows is an action and laugh-laden adventure which brings even more of what made the first film such a success to the audience as the film takes the bawdy action of the first and ups the ante thanks in large part to an expanded budget and cast.\nMy biggest concern for the film was that with an expanded budget there would be too many characters and an attempt to do far too much with the film. That did play out at times in the beginning as for me, the first film worked so well as they had to let the characters rather than the action and effects carry it and the rapid-fire arrival of so many jokes and creative profanity made repeat viewing of the film necessary to catch everything.\n\nThis time out we get elaborate action and chase sequences as well as a much larger cast. At times it seemed as if this would possibly overshadow the characters and story but Reynolds and Director David Leith never let it cross that line.\nThey also go back to the core elements in the final third of the film which really allows the film to fully connect with the tone of the original film and brings the film home to a satisfying conclusion.  What really sold the film for me was the brilliant and very inspired extended scene during the credits which allows Deadpool to “fix” various issues which perfectly captures the irreverent character and the best aspects of the series where the cast is willing to make fun of themselves as well as the larger universe in which their characters exist.\n\nI cannot wait to see what comes next as “DeadPool 2” is another fun outing for the character and something very different from most comic based movies.\n\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2018-05-15T03:57:07.609Z","id":"5afa5a93925141414b005cf0","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:08.685Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5afa5a93925141414b005cf0"},{"author":"TobyBenson","author_details":{"name":"","username":"TobyBenson","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"An utterly hilarious movie, with hundreds of pop culture references.

Was there a lot of juvenile jokes? Oh yes. Was the characters sometimes over the top and silly? Yes again. Was the script and story anything to write home about? Of course not! Was there a lot of gratuitous violence? Hell yes! But then, this was pretty much what could be expected. Anyone offended or surprised by this should not really have picked this movie in the first place.\r\n\r\nDespite the fairly juvenile jokes, the sometime illogical script and the way over the top chop-chop-and-chop-some-more violence I had great fun watching this movie. I really enjoyed the action sequences a’la Kill Bill, the special effects and yes, the jokes. Most of the time at least)\r\n\r\nEverything was so silly and over the top that it actually became funny. Each scene, taken by itself, would probably have been considered silly, or even bad, by me but stringed together in the context of the movie as a whole it just worked. For me at least.\r\n\r\nThe action sequences, CGI and everything that should be in a superhero movie was, in my mind, quite good. Also, despite not really being anything to write home about the story was quite adequate. Simple, straightforward and a lot better than the crap that a lot of the stuff that social and political correctness preaching writers at Marvel are spewing out these days.\r\n\r\nI definitely liked Cable as the hard hitting ass-kicking cyborg. When Domino was first introduced I was not impressed, even though she’s hot. I mean, luck as a superpower? However, when she started to pull all these hilarious stunts with these incredibly unbelievable chains of events I quickly changed my mind. Oh, and I did like Deadpool of course. That goes without saying. If you do not like the main protagonist it is difficult to like the movie itself is it not?\r\n\r\nMost of the other characters were between okay and so so. The one character I never really liked was Firefist. He was never funny, just incredibly stupid and childish.\r\n\r\nThe team of fellow mutant “warriors” that Deadpool pulled together? Well let’s say that I am not that disappointed that they were somewhat “expendable” but it looks like that was the whole point of it. When the first of them whammed into that bus I thought “What the f…?” and then it just continued with one gory event following another. Nice touch with the blue blood by the way. I guess the guy was an alien after all.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, a lot of the movie was pretty much what I expected but altogether I think I was positively surprised. Two hours of great fun actually.","created_at":"2018-10-21T08:47:37.989Z","id":"5bcc3d29925141612d0047c3","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:13.789Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5bcc3d29925141612d0047c3"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":6},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":194188,"title":"Deadpool

In addition to the impressive visuals, hilarious comedy bits, and thrilling action sequences, Shawn Levy, Matt Lieberman, and Zak Penn offer a brilliant narrative that deeply explores human nature and what the viewers perceive as \"real\". Superb acting from the entire cast, namely Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer, and jaw-dropping cameos genuinely elevate the overall experience. Honestly, it might be the very first movie to prove that Disney owning every major studio also has its perks. What could have been \"just a videogame flick\" is actually a nerdgasmic, super exciting viewing with emotionally compelling characters and an extraordinarily smart story.

But then the flick degenerates into the same old, same old: boring villain, plot is unoriginal, action is magic, hacking is imagined by someone not owning a computer (probably just a smart phone) and finally, the philosophical idea of a first AI ever is not explored in the slightest.\r\n\r\nI know this is just supposed to be a \"feel-good\" film, but critical thinkers will not feel good watching this drivel. Something this trivial simply does not deserve a high score, even if it does what it's supposed to.","created_at":"2021-09-24T11:20:22.960Z","id":"614db4769f51af009364dd42","updated_at":"2021-09-24T11:20:22.960Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/614db4769f51af009364dd42"},{"author":"Cal","author_details":{"name":"Cal","username":"bycalvin","avatar_path":null,"rating":8.0},"content":"Free Guy was unexpected...\r\n\r\nThis movie was a unexpected good movie to watch.  \r\n\r\nRyan Reynolds has quietly put together some good movies with her sense of humor / personality coming out in the roles he plays.

This tall budget, combined with public hesitancy to return to theaters and the Delta variant of COVID seemingly on the verge of backtracking all the progress we’ve made since the vaccine became readily available to the public, it makes you wonder if _Free Guy_ has any sort of chance of making a respectable amount of money at the box office or even just breaking even.\r\n\r\nNote: This was originally written when the film opened in theaters. _Free Guy_ would go on to make $331.5 million on a $100-$125 million budget. A sequel is currently in the works. \r\n\r\n**Full review**:

Inside her mind comes five emotions, all with different perceptions of life.\r\n\r\nThere's Joy, who takes charge and her job is to keep Riley content, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, and together, they work together (or try) to keep Riley from harming herself. They live together in the headquarters, or Riley's head, and they look after Riley's memories.\r\n\r\nAfter eleven years of enjoyment and content, Riley and her parents are forced to move out of Minnesota, away from her friends and hockey team, and moves to the city of San Francisco inside a desolate and cold house.\r\n\r\nBut things get even more anarchic when Joy and Sadness are sundered away from the rest of the gang, holding onto Riley's core memories that make Riley, well, Riley. One by one, the islands of personality fall apart as the rest of the gang back in headquarters watch in dismay and anguish. After all, Joy is not there to keep things under control.\r\n\r\nInside Out truly contemplates the hardships of growing up, but every problem comes to a heart-wrenching solution. The movie truly captivates this and continues the Pixar tradition of inspiration, family, and friendship in a little bit under two hours.

It is very imaginative, for a start, colorful in ways that capture the eye, and its message is as deep as you want it to be.\r\n\r\nBy that I mean it would be productive and fun to watch this with children of all ages. The older or more mature the child is, the deeper you can delve into the issues of what to do about feelings of anger, sadness, and so on. With young children, you could even watch it first time through as it is, and save comments or life lessons for additional viewings. There is plenty of action and humor to be found here to entertain hem on that level.\r\n\r\nAnd as a side note, we have no small children to watch this with, but it is also a good movie for adults to settle into, especially during times of stress or worry. We read a recommendation for it during the COVID19 crisis.","created_at":"2020-04-04T00:26:46.806Z","id":"5e87d446b84f940014c8f32c","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:36.304Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5e87d446b84f940014c8f32c"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Sweet story.\r\n\r\n<em>'Inside Out'</em> produces an entertaining, heartfelt 95 minutes. I like how the characters work and how their world is set up, conceptually it works very nicely but visually I don't love it - something about the way it looks is kinda plain to me. While Joy & Co. are memorable, the voices behind them aren't all that standout in my opinion.\r\n\r\nPhyllis Smith is my pick of the cast, she is the perfect person to play the character Sadness. Amy Poehler (Joy) and Lewis Black (Anger) are more than satisfactory, too.\r\n\r\nIt has a good message and meaning, for me it's just missing something extra. Still enjoyed it though.","created_at":"2020-09-02T15:59:52.888Z","id":"5f4fc17879b3d400323b1998","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:43.866Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f4fc17879b3d400323b1998"},{"author":"Kamurai","author_details":{"name":"Kamurai","username":"Kamurai","avatar_path":"/sKeC7qZLAKreuwxH4x6U3mN7Aa8.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is a wonderfully little story of world building and exploration of the human mind through a young teen girl who is scare of the huge amount of change happening in her life.

Looking at the numbers, The Nun holds the box office record, being the most successful movie of the saga financially, but ironically enough, it's also the most disliked film by both critics and audience members. The viral marketing campaign obviously hyped this spin-off to an unbelievable level of expectation, but it's still strange that it took five years to deliver another The Conjuring flick since both previous installments were tremendously profitable as well.\r\n\r\nWith James Wan out of the director's chair and without a screenplay credit, my expectations weren't exactly high. Wan is one of the main reasons why The Conjuring movies work so well. From his ability to generate an enormous amount of suspense to the actually scary atmosphere, Wan is definitely one of the best horror directors of the last decade. Therefore, replacing him would always be a challenging task. Michael Chaves directed The Curse of La Llorona, a generic, bland horror flick that didn't have a single surprising element. However, I did compliment Chaves' work with the horror sequences since I did find them somewhat effective. So, I was still feeling optimistic about The Devil Made Me Do It...\r\n\r\nIt's admittedly the weakest film of the trilogy, but it's still far from the awful Annabelle Comes Home or the hideous origin story about the famous nun. When it comes to the main titles, the exceptional production value is something all have in common. In fact, this latest flick is arguably the best-looking one. The horror sequences look stunning on the big screen, and the sound design is extremely impactful as always. It's worth remembering that this franchise doesn't waste hundreds of millions to make its movies, being a relatively low-budget cinematic universe, especially when compared to every other studio's massive sagas. Practical effects are always the go-to if possible, keeping the use of CGI to the minimum.\r\n\r\nActing-wise, it's also where these films triumph. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga share palpable chemistry, deeply elevating their characters' emotional connection. At its core, The Conjuring features a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren, ultimately being their grounded, convincing, loving relationship that keeps the viewers interested in the least \"based on a true story\" events. Both actors deliver remarkable performances, as does the legendary John Noble (The Lord of the Rings, Fringe) as a former priest. I didn't know about his casting before the movie, so I was genuinely surprised by seeing Noble on the big screen again. He's absolutely phenomenal, as expected, and quite creepy as a mysterious character.\r\n\r\nEveryone else is decent enough, but I don't find any other interpretation worth noting. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go compliment-wise. The primary narrative surrounding the actual case that gives the name to the film is nowhere near as interesting as the stories told in the previous The Conjuring movies. The case itself doesn't have much to tell, so the majority of the film rests on following the beloved couple going on side quests as detectives. Eventually, the clues found are connected to the main plot, but overall, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay isn't that captivating. Despite the predictability and formulaic horror elements, there's a rather enjoyable \"twist\" to the whole \"demon possession\" routine that marks the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nThe biggest disappointment is something I feared would happen without James Wan at the helm. The once terrifying, suspenseful atmosphere during the effective, creative jumpscare sequences now gives place to the generic build-up that viewers experience in some of the cheapest horror movies of today. Due to a character's health issue, the tension levels are constantly high for this person in particular, but for most of the runtime, the general environment lacks the essential scary feeling. The jumpscares look lazy and too obvious, a cliche that The Conjuring films fought hard to distance themselves from. In addition to this, it's a much darker movie than the rest in terms of lighting.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have mixed feelings about the ending. Without spoiling it, of course, it's similar to A Quiet Place Part II in the sense that two different sequences need to be edited together seamlessly so the viewers can easily follow what's happening without losing the tension and suspense. One of these scenes is particularly shaky, repetitive, and overly dark, which definitely left me a bit disappointed. Peter Gvozdas and Christian Wagner's editing is really good, though. Michael Burgess' cinematography offers a couple of gorgeous shots, and Joseph Bishara's score maintains the ominous tone of the franchise. James Wan is clearly missed, but Michael Chaves didn't do a bad job.\r\n\r\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is undoubtedly the weakest installment of the trilogy, but it's still quite far from the awful level of the worst films of the horror franchise. Boasting the trademark terrific production value of the saga, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga deliver outstanding lead performances as the only two emotionally compelling characters. Overall, every element is lesser than the previous The Conjuring movies. From the less scary atmosphere to the unimaginative, generic jumpscares, Michael Chaves isn't able to replicate James Wan's tremendous levels of suspense and tension, despite a brilliant opening sequence. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay focuses on many storylines indirectly connected to the main plot, ending up with a not-that-interesting narrative that doesn't quite justify the main title. Some technical attributes, mainly the editing and cinematography, as well as sound design, compensate with some entertainment. In the end, I still recommend it to fans of the cinematic universe and lovers of the horror genre.\r\n\r\nRating: B-","created_at":"2021-06-06T15:17:33.318Z","id":"60bce70dbb26020057a5dd78","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:56.656Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60bce70dbb26020057a5dd78"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Decent enough third entry that gets a little goofy at the end but I liked it, though not quite as good as the first two.

It belongs to the genres of religion, crime, horror and drama, and it’s part of the “Conjuring Universe.” The trial of Arne Johnson inspired the movie. The film is not precisely the reproduction of what happened. But we need to remember that it’s a movie, and fiction is mandatory for our entertainment. And the film is engaging. It provides moments of pure adrenaline and pieces of beautiful cinematography and photography. Although it is not perfect, we think it deserves your time because God, daemons and exorcisms, apparently, are with us, believe it or not. Let us explain it to you. - **The Story** - In July 1981, Ed and Lorraine Warren, a couple who specialised in paranormal investigations, were helping the Glatzel. Their eight-year son David was experiencing unexplained and disturbing symptoms, which were consuming David and the whole family. So the Warren decides that it’s time for a real exorcism, and they go to document it.\r\nBut something terrible and unexpected is going to happen, and also the Warren get surprised. In fact, the event degenerates into an escalation of violence, murder, and occult rituals. The case became a worldwide event because, for the first time in history, the defence lawyer brought in front of the court the fact that a demon possessed the killer. Will the lawyer succeed with her defence? What is that Ed and Lorraine are going to prove?And what is your opinion about this surreal but true story? - **Full Analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/the-conjuring-the-devil-made-me-do-it-2021-movie-review-and-analysis/**","created_at":"2021-11-08T21:40:43.645Z","id":"6189995b69d28000449a9de9","updated_at":"2021-11-08T21:40:43.645Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6189995b69d28000449a9de9"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1495244,"title":"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It","original_title":"The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It","plot_overview":"Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren encounter what would become one of the most sensational cases from their files.

a delay lasting 19 months; the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has returned to the big screen with “Black Widow”. The film takes place between “Captain America: Civil War” and “Avengers: Infinity War”; audiences get more of the backstory of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), as we are introduced to her early life before the Red Room.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the film is an origin story as it uses her backstory through a clever introduction that establishes her “family” as sleeper agents in Ohio before they escape and she and her cover sister are tuned over for conditioning and training.\r\n\r\nSince Natasha is on the run from the authorities; she finds a remote location in Norway to bide her time. This does not last as a dangerous adversary known as the Taskmaster arrives and sets a chain of events into motion.\r\n\r\nNatasha has been sent a package from her cover sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) who also went through the Red Room and became a top assassin in the years since she and Natasha last saw one another.\r\n\r\nDespite her mixed feelings; Natasha ventures to Budapest and confronts Yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains a compound that can free the other Black Widows from the control of the Red Room which despite Natasha’s insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago.\r\n\r\nWith Taskmaster and other Widows hot on their trail, Natasha and Yelena are forced to seek the help of their former “Father” the imprisoned hero Red Guardian (David Harbour), and their cover Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz), to find the location of the new Red Room; free the Widows, and end the program once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core a character story as Natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new Avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning.\r\n\r\nMarvel resisted calls from some to release the film on Disney+ last year when the Pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates. This decision to me was very wise as this is a film that needs to be seen and heard on the big screen as it is an experience that is best experienced in a cinema with others.\r\n\r\nWhile many attempts were made over the decades to adapt comic heroes to film and television; most of them came up lacking and disappointed fans of the source material. Marvel for over a decade has continued to succeed as they have a clear plan, cast well, and have engaging characters that develop over time.\r\n\r\n“Black Widow” fills in a missing gap of time in the MCU well and also sets up future adventures as a scene in the credits clearly links two of the live-action Disney+ series and shows that the long-term plan for the MCU continues and incorporates the film and television series well.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the Marvel intro and music appeared on the screen until the very end; “Black Widow” was a very enjoyable and engaging blockbuster adventure that shows Marvel at the top of their game; and why they continue to set event-level movies not to miss.\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-06-29T16:07:43.200Z","id":"60db454f0b73160045632c08","updated_at":"2021-06-29T16:07:43.200Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60db454f0b73160045632c08"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/black-widow-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Black Widow beautifully honors the iconic Natasha Romanoff, who finally receives the respectful, worthy solo film that her unforgettable legacy always deserved. Cate Shortland and Eric Pearson put together an MCU installment that doesn't really compare to any of the other origin flicks, profoundly examining the protagonist's dark past and her complex \"family\" through distinctly compelling storytelling. Scarlett Johansson shines one last time, interpreting the most impactful role of her career, but Florence Pugh comes close to stealing the spotlight by giving an absolutely phenomenal display. Boasting highly entertaining, mostly well-filmed action sequences, the main narrative follows a path with no surprises, as well as a generic villain, but the emotionally investing storylines regarding Natasha's personal motivations and Yelena's complex feelings keep the film remarkably captivating. The ending is as satisfying as I could have ever wished for. A loving farewell to a hero that inspired millions of viewers.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2021-07-08T18:23:00.947Z","id":"60e74284b76cbb0073e80020","updated_at":"2021-07-08T18:23:00.947Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60e74284b76cbb0073e80020"},{"author":"Mahnoor Khan","author_details":{"name":"Mahnoor Khan","username":"Mahnoor_Khan","avatar_path":"/wER6MfaKV3swJdjrvRHXwBQxBIw.png","rating":null},"content":"The first half of black widow was very strong and emotional. Florence Pugh was stellar in this movie. She was brilliant in action sequences and I like the fun elements in her character. Yelena and Natasha's chemistry was too good. David Harbour also performed very well. \r\n\r\nThe action sequences were good but CGI was too weak in the 3d act. Also, I didn't like the changes in Natasha's character. She has no superpowers like other avengers. Her strong brain and mind combine to make her a lethal weapon but they showed her over powerful in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe inner wounds of Natasha were beautifully delivered in this movie.

Far too much bad MCU banter to go with something that wants to be grounded and quite frankly none of the actors are quite adapt at those sitcomy whedonisms that these movies made mainstream (Pugh in particular is terrible at those bits). Some of the mid section action is better than average as far as those movies goes but anything with Taskmasker is very bad and the big end is terrible. Winstone villain made me miss when people like Lonsdale and Lee made lousy Moore Bond plots half watchable. The major limitation is that far too much of the emotional beats depend on what characters talk about their time together when they were a pretend family and altough Johansson and Pugh have good chemistry and Weisz and Harbour do as good job as possible under the circunstances of selling their regrets, there just isn't enough downtime between plot needs to anything of it truly land. I can get what Shortland was hoping to import into one of those but little actually works even with the benefit of a far more standalone movie than most of them. Also, strange how after a decade of postponing giving Johansson her movie, they did one in which she so often feels like a witness/connective MCU tissue for the main supporting characters family drama that they had to give her an extra subplot with her guilty over \"killing\" Winstone's daughter so it can feel like she has more material to work with.

However, after seeing the deep dives into characters that had been on the sidelines for years, this movie felt very surface level of the complexity of Natasha Romanoff. She was taken as a child to learn how to be an assassin, she had to sacrifice her morals to leave her past behind, she basically remained an assassin for a different organization that turned out to be run by similarly bad people as those she left, and she is now on the run from the government that once hailed her a hero because she didn’t fall in line. Oh, and she is reconnecting with her past fake family that gave her and Yelena back to the Red Room as soon as the mission was over. The trauma this character endured would’ve been better explored as a mini series, rather than a movie that’s trying to simultaneously remind us of where Natasha was five years ago and also trying not to acknowledge that Natasha has no risk posed to her in this movie because we know she lives on past these events. However, very excited to see where Yelena goes in the future.","created_at":"2021-08-20T21:57:37.514Z","id":"612025512e0697005da5a605","updated_at":"2021-08-24T22:28:05.241Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/612025512e0697005da5a605"},{"author":"Trevfh","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Trevfh","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2c7fd662c4d409bbc2c5077b5865116.jpg","rating":null},"content":"It was okay","created_at":"2021-09-09T03:16:53.429Z","id":"61397ca566a0d30042b56554","updated_at":"2021-09-09T17:15:04.311Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61397ca566a0d30042b56554"},{"author":"xut","author_details":{"name":"","username":"xut","avatar_path":null,"rating":1.0},"content":"It's crap, really.

It’s fantastic that women are getting more opportunities in big summer blockbusters like this one, but it’s also disheartening since their filmmaking skills are shackled to formulaic superfluity that obviously stands in the way of creating extraordinary cinema. \r\n\r\nFull review: https://geekshavegame.com/black-widow-review-espionage-exhaustion/","created_at":"2021-10-06T12:11:48.151Z","id":"615d92848e2ba6008beb8349","updated_at":"2021-10-06T12:11:48.151Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/615d92848e2ba6008beb8349"},{"author":"misubisu","author_details":{"name":"","username":"misubisu","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"Waited so long for this movie to come out and I was loaded with anticipation. \r\nWhen it finally landed I was so excited to watch it!\r\nI must say, it didn't go in the direction that I was expecting (based on the on the other solo movies)... but I was very pleasantly surprised, and it was way better than I was expecting it to be.\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it was a fitting tribute yo one of my favourite Marvel Universe characters.","created_at":"2022-01-22T03:57:43.822Z","id":"61eb80b74df29100435cc066","updated_at":"2022-02-02T14:12:45.020Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61eb80b74df29100435cc066"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"**Black Widow is a decent MCU film with excellent entertaining characters but an average to disappointing story.**\r\n\r\nBlack Widow faced steep expectations as Marvel's first female-led film focused on a cherished MCU favorite. Black Widow's past was always shrouded in mystery and pain, but she was finally receiving the attention the hero deserved to dive into her past and celebrate Scarlett Johansson's super spy. With hopes high and fans wanting a Captain America: The Winter Soldier-type superhero espionage film, Black Widow, unfortunately, fell short. Nothing was particularly disappointing about the film. I had just hoped for so much more for the character and Scarlett Johansson at this point in the MCU's journey. The effects and action were decent. The villain was forgettable. The big defining Budapest incident was passed by with hardly any impact or emotional weight. Black Widow gets lost in all of the chaos of the film. The best part of the movie by far was the new characters played by Florence Pugh and David Harbor. They were highly entertaining, funny, and endearing. I hope to see Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova in many more Marvel films. Black Widow really was a decent entry in the Marvel universe and one of the better Phase 4 movies. Still, it didn't do Natasha Romanoff the justice she deserved leaving the character's best moments in other Marvel films that focused on other heroes.","created_at":"2022-10-21T20:07:29.550Z","id":"6352fc01f8e98200817b13df","updated_at":"2022-10-21T20:07:29.628Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6352fc01f8e98200817b13df"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":11},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1501613,"title":"Black Widow","original_title":"Black Widow","plot_overview":"Natasha Romanoff, also known as Black Widow, confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises.

Lana Wachowski delivers a surprisingly meta, self-aware movie about the original trilogy packed with bold, fascinating ideas but an absolutely terrible execution.\r\n\r\nFrom the dreadfully unfunny, cringe-worthy brainstorming sessions about the previous films to the heavy-handed, headache-inducing exposition, the director constantly tries to tell the viewers how incredible the original trilogy is, forgetting to create a compelling, captivating story for this new installment.\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous visuals and impactful score aren't good enough to elevate the shockingly average, choppy action sequences. Despite remarkable performances from Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and the standout Jessica Henwick, Resurrections just didn't work for me.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the franchise, I obviously recommend watching it. Just be aware that this isn't a new The Matrix movie, but instead a film about the actual saga.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C-","created_at":"2021-12-24T14:38:29.709Z","id":"61c5db65b6c264001cf700b5","updated_at":"2021-12-24T14:38:29.709Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61c5db65b6c264001cf700b5"},{"author":"Dark Matter","author_details":{"name":"Dark Matter","username":"hemantrmore","avatar_path":null,"rating":6.0},"content":"SPOILERS!!\r\nIf you believe that this story was written by Thomas Anderson in another Model, under the pressure of the peers with the help of the Analyst then it is worthy to give at least 4 stars to this movie.

It's not so much that the story is weak (it is), it's that it all takes far too long for the \"Neo\" (Keanu Reeves) and \"Trinity\" (Carrie-Anne Moss) characters to get up and running. Reeves has largely lost his freshness and vivacity and the baddies exude all the menace of a wet lettuce. At best the supporting casting borders on the bizarre - Jonathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris are both far better sticking to their more familiar genres, and Jessica Henwick's \"Bugs\" character, though feisty, was just far too flat. The graphics are all old hat, as are the time-shifting themes and action scenes. There is plenty of gun totin', but nothing at all innovative. This was entertaining and escapist stuff first time around in 1999, but at 2½ hours this is slow and repetitive with some seriously wilting dialogue and the real time/their time narrative just bored me. It certainly looks good on a big screen, I fear what little it does have will not work at all on the television, but otherwise - sorry, this is poor.","created_at":"2022-03-27T11:37:22.326Z","id":"62404c7281a7fc00472d0b27","updated_at":"2022-03-27T11:37:22.326Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62404c7281a7fc00472d0b27"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**Nostalgia is the only thing that will make this mess enjoyable.**\r\n\r\nWelcoming exciting new characters, introducing new threats and alliances, and resurrecting classic characters seemed to promise the next chapter worth getting our hopes up. With the return of Reeves and Moss, we had even more reason to believe! And the movie was decent... but not what we had hoped. My biggest disappointment was the action sequences. What once raised the bar on choreographed fight sequences fell below its predecessors and landed in the typical shakey cam fighting we see in many lazy action movies today. Neo's force push powers also became a disappointing solution to every dangerous situation. It wasn't horrible, but in its attempt to be meta and self-aware, The Matrix Resurrections forgot what made the franchise great.","created_at":"2022-08-20T00:22:31.096Z","id":"63002947097c4900910fcc56","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:20:00.387Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63002947097c4900910fcc56"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":7},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1586886,"title":"The

what is being billed as the final Purge movie; “The Forever Purge” has arrived and like elements of the prior films; gains traction from current events which have only made elements of the film more chilling seeing how the film was originally planned for July of 2020.\r\n\r\nFollowing the abolition of the Purge at the end of the “Purge Election Year”; the Holiday where all crime is legal for twelve hours is restored due to radical elements fueling fears of illegal immigration and the increase in crime immigrants will bring to the largely crime-free country.\r\n\r\nIt is not made clear what happened with the new President who was a staunch critic of the Purge and only that it has been restored so citizens prepare for its return by arming up, barricading themselves, or paying for armed security in a fortified locale.\r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that Adela (Ana de Reguera) has come to America fleeing the violence in her country as she enters illegally and finds work. Dylan Tucker (Josh Lucas) is a wealthy Rancher who along with his family hires friends and family of Adela though having some disdain for them and what they stand for.\r\n\r\nThe Purge comes and goes with the main cast unaffected and as they prepare to resume their lives; roving bands of armed gangs have continued to Purge in violation of the law similar to those who took to the street in protest of the election and plans to eliminate the Purge years prior.\r\n\r\nThis new group is well organized and has no issues taking on law enforcement and the military forcing Dylan, Adela, and their family and friends to flee for their lives. As the terror spreads, their only safety is to try to make it to Mexico who along with Canada has agreed to a six hour window to allow people to cross to escape the violence.\r\n\r\nAs the danger mounts, the severity of the movement is known as the authorities seem powerless to control and stop what is called The Forever Purge.\r\n\r\nThe film uses a slightly different formula than the prior films which focused mainly on a group of people trying to survive the night and the terrors that come with Purge Night.  There is a greater emphasis on racism and Xenophobia this time around directed more towards foreigners than minorities and poverty-stricken individuals but the underlying message is the same.\r\n\r\nThis time around we are given a longer timeframe of terror and more social commentary as there are elements from the film which seem eerily inspired by headlines past and present which makes the film even more chilling.\r\n\r\nWhile the story is rather bare and the characters do not get much development; the movie should give fans of the series what they look forward to although it lacks the dramatic tension of the previous films.\r\n\r\nIn the end “The Forever Purge” is an interesting new chapter in the series but not one of the stronger entries and serves as an effective finale to the series should this turn out to be the final film.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-06-30T19:07:16.136Z","id":"60dcc0e47e403d005d8ef249","updated_at":"2021-06-30T19:07:16.136Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60dcc0e47e403d005d8ef249"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"A lackluster _Purge_ entry at best that is only considered decent because the film that came before it is so awful,  _The Forever Purge_ does put some effort into attempting to put a different spin on how we view immigrants, but even that seems half-cocked at best.\r\n\r\nWith a concept this stagnant, _The Forever Purge_ has successfully done what other horror movies have never been able to do; make deaths, murdering, and killing a total bore. Hopefully, with any luck, _The Purge_ franchise will pillage and murder itself with this entry.\r\n\r\n**Full review**:

Adam Project is a sci-fi movie that takes you on a wild, CGI-filled flight that is out of this world-with futuristic technology that makes you excited but also afraid of what could come, The sci-fi elements look so realistic - as realistic as those can be - that it gives the impression that the cinematographers used time travel themselves to capture these scenes.\r\n\r\nExceptional fight scenes that defy gravity. This film also takes you into some very realistic topics, too, like grieving for a loved one, being bullied by classmates and accepting who you are.\r\n\r\nRyan Reynolds is in front of us with the same character he has been playing for the last 15 years.\r\nWhat really surprises me is the harmony of someone like Reynolds, who was in front of the camera with the world's greatest actors and actresses, with Walker Scobell, who had his first acting experience at the age of 12.  They made a great duo team.\r\n\r\nThe overall storyline of the movie is creative, but it does not really have any unique plot twists nor is it fully developed. And as a result, this film comes off a little bland and seems to be missing something.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't promise much as it is what we've always been seeing but it's pretty good at delivering what it promises. \r\nLong story short, 'The Adam Project' is a movie made to entertain the audience and it succeeds.\r\n•\r\n•\r\nEnjoyment Rating: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟/5\r\n•\r\nOverall Score: 8.0/10","created_at":"2022-03-22T07:25:56.945Z","id":"62397a0434e15200462b63aa","updated_at":"2022-03-28T16:42:35.235Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62397a0434e15200462b63aa"},{"author":"SpotaMovie.com","author_details":{"name":"SpotaMovie.com","username":"bastag","avatar_path":"/h9FkucYmSN3YH5OmrNRWO5rdquS.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"**Full Analysis at Spotamovie.com** - **Intro** - Released in March 2022, The Adam Project is a movie for those who love Sci-Fi, actions, CGI, and those who wish to change their past to let any regrets disappear. The Adam Project delivers a combination of funny entertainment and some meaningful messages. Ryan Reynolds and the director, Shawn Levy, are back together after the incredible success of Free Guy. - **The Story** - Adam Reed is a young boy grieving his father’s death and suffering the pains of bullying. Then, one night he found a wounded pilot in his dad’s garage. The intruder needs Adam’s help because he risked everything for a secret mission to be back in time. But, the operation can’t fail because the world is in grave danger. The real challenge for the task is that both of them don’t like each other. So, some questions are mandatory: Who is the pilot? Why is this mission so dangerous for the world? And what is the reason that moves the pilot to this desperate operation? But also, what are we going to learn from this story? - **We will explain all of this in our review and analysis available at https://www.spotamovie.com/the-adam-project-review-and-explanation-critic-post-movie-netflix-movie-2022/**","created_at":"2022-03-28T16:38:47.465Z","id":"6241e4973e09f30087c16c14","updated_at":"2022-03-28T16:38:47.465Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6241e4973e09f30087c16c14"},{"author":"RADIO1'S MR.

Film Seen around March 27, 2022. It -{ ISN'T }- \"very likely\" to be released in Cinemas.( Made For STREAMING ).\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nEllie { Young Adam's Mom }: \"This's the third time you've been suspended for fighting\".\r\n\r\nYoung Adam: \"I know. You'd think I'd be better at it by now!!!\"\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nIf you're someone who's presently in the mood to take a -Welcome- Break from all the doom and gloom on the news right now and watch a movie that comes **\"FULL-CIRCLE\"** in the most Enthralling, Engaging, and indeed -{ Heartwarming }- of ways . . . then I wish to -Wholeheartedly- recommend \"The Adam Project\", **( TAP for short ),** to you. The only -Other- cinematic experience I've had where a film came Full-Circle in -Such- beautiful fashion, in -Recent- memory at least, would be the simply Fabulous \"SpiderMan: No Way Home\" **( \"SM-NWH\" ).** It is a picture that literally ( And -Very- Cleverly ) ties up loose ends within the -{ Entire }- Spiderman CANON of films, from as far back as 2002. It also just happens to be the -Last- Massive Blockbuster that I reviewed ; before going on an -Entirely- unplanned, ( but -Incredibly- refreshing ) 'Extended 101-day hiatus from reviewing'.\r\n\r\nOk, so if you thought that the 13 yr. old \"Newcomer\" of said film, pint-sized thespian  Walker Scobell was a tremendous -Dramatic- actor, well, then you'd only be -Half- right. The fact of the mater is... he's also a terrific **-COMEDIC-** talent, with seriously \"Impeccable\" timing, especially given that this is, get this ...his -{ First Ever }- movie or TV ( 'Feature' ) appearance. Factor Walker's \"Super-Fun\" performance in alongside a 'full spectrum' of absolute **-{ \"POWERHOUSE!\" }-** deliveries from the film's unequivocal ensemble principal cast of Protagonists ( Zoe Saldaña, Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner,  ) . . . then add in some absolutely -Fantastic- ( & truly state of the art ) CGI, a genuinely -Mindblowing- grand finale set piece ...and the kind of fight choreography that you really have to -See- ...to believe . . . & you have a seriously, seriously exciting picture, indeed.\r\n\r\nNot to mention **FUNNY AS HELL!!!** I really hadn't laughed so hard in a long time ; -since- ( about the 3rd time ) I watched SM-NWH, to be precise. On the downside, though . . . & if I'm to be 'painfully' honest . . . -Both- the Villain ( ...don't get me wrong, the person who plays the main 'baddie' is a Veteran performer ; I just felt like the Writing there could have been just that \"Little Bit Stronger\"... ) -And- her 'ever loyal' henchman are a 'tad weak', as is the very title of the film, itself. Even something as ( relatively ) simple as **\"FLASH-BACK-FORWARD\",** would have been -{ Far }- catchier than its existing name, ( although I do think I sorta understand -Why- they called it what they did, for what it's worth ). It's for these two reasons -Alone- that I -Didn't- give it my trademark \"25/10\" ; reserved especially for movies That Move Me **-{ VERY }-** Deeply, as TAP ( ...quite obviously... ) -Did-.\r\n\r\nSummary: This is a picture that, ( among -several- other things ), pointedly asks the question: If you could -{ Somehow }- go back in time, & talk to your Younger-Self... **\"WHAT'D YOU SAY?\"** ...& in the most -Intriguing- of ways, at that. Furthermore, having lost my Dearly Beloved Father when I was -Just- 13, in a horrible, brutal car crash, TAP resonated with me **PROFOUNDLY.** It is has some Genuinely **\"TENDER\"** Moments, &  does a **-Phenomenal-** job of addressing the issue of 'Estranged Father-Son Relationships' the world over, but most especially in the USA ; ( where the film is also -Set- ) ; and where the issue is quite possibly now almost at epidemic levels, what with the country's sky-high divorce rate, separation rate, & just plain old 'Absentee Father-ism', in general. All said & done, the  **\"EVER-DYNAMIC!** Duo\" of Actor Ryan Reynolds & Director Shawn Levy have well & truly \"Done it Again\". Although this **-ISN'T-** a Marvel movie, It -does- star a **\"Handful Of Marvel's Best & Brightest\"** and -is- ultimately, \" A ( not so ) little cinematic streaming **MARVEL** 🌠 \", in its 'Very Own Right'. Sadly, I'm not able to give TAP my 'Absoluuut-High-Score' ( as I explained a bit earlier ), but it -Still- earns a **\"Majestic, Rock Solid 13 Marks Out Of 10 Marks\"** from me . . . **NONETHELESS!!!**","created_at":"2022-04-22T08:20:23.925Z","id":"626265476eecee30f0d060f9","updated_at":"2022-05-09T15:35:36.625Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/626265476eecee30f0d060f9"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Despite having shades of _Back to the Future_, _The Adam Project_ finds a way to pave its own path to deliver a fun and heartwarming story about self-forgiveness. The movie starts incredibly strong, introducing the viewer to the main characters. The chemistry between the two actors is fantastic and feels really genuine, creating an instant connection between the two and the audience. Walker Scobell does an excellent job doing his best Ryan Reynolds impersonation, making me really buy into the fact that they are the same character. This pace carries on up until the second act when characters and lore are being thrown at the viewer left and right. This section feels incredibly rushed resulting in the viewer having very little emotional connection with the ideas introduced. Zoe Saldana and Mark Ruffalo do a fantastic job with the limited screen time that they have, it was great seeing them outside of their standard CGI suits (looking at you Marvel). The antagonist wore her welcome towards the end of the film as her antics seemed a little forced. The comedy in this movie was done fairly well. I enjoyed the fast sarcastic nature of the boy and his back and forth with Reynolds, but some jokes did fall flat. But that is par for the course in any comedy. Overall, this film was enjoyable and even though it had its faults I appreciated the concepts it delivered.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_","created_at":"2022-07-07T23:54:34.371Z","id":"62c7723ac68b69004cdea299","updated_at":"2022-07-15T15:10:42.299Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62c7723ac68b69004cdea299"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**Overall : Its sincere story results in one of Netflix's better original movies.**\r\n\r\nA surprisingly heartfelt film that shocked me with how well it made me care for each of its characters. I watched this movie with low expectations due to Netflix's disappointing track record of mediocre original movies. Each actor felt typecast into roles they had played before but still delivered meaningful performances. The effects and production were fairly typical of a Netflix project. But even though I can't say each specific part of The Adam Project was particularly remarkable, the sum of all its parts was fantastic! The writing mixed with the cast's solid performances just equals something great. The standout by far was Walker Scobell's excellent portrayal of young Ryan Reynolds.","created_at":"2022-08-19T23:04:08.127Z","id":"630016e8532acb00844c934c","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:16:42.701Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630016e8532acb00844c934c"},{"author":"[robbie grawey]","author_details":{"name":"[robbie grawey]","username":"robbiegrawey","avatar_path":"/qB7lELWBr2iNbKu3eYBI2bxzJ7I.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Ruffalo says “old bean”, good stuff.","created_at":"2022-09-12T21:32:44.909Z","id":"631fa57c9c24fc007d77c34a","updated_at":"2022-09-16T20:46:09.105Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/631fa57c9c24fc007d77c34a"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":6}},{"id":1609996,"title":"The Adam Project","original_title":"The Adam Project","plot_overview":"After accidentally crash-landing in 2022, time-traveling fighter pilot Adam Reed teams up with his 12-year-old self on a mission to save the future.","type":"movie","runtime_minutes":106,"year":2022,"end_year":null,"release_date":"2022-03-11","imdb_id":"tt2463208","tmdb_id":696806,"tmdb_type":"movie","genres":[2,15],"genre_names":["Adventure","Science Fiction"],"user_rating":7,"critic_score":61,"us_rating":"PG-13","poster":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/posters/01609996_poster_w185.jpg","backdrop":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/backdrops/01609996_bd_w780.jpg","original_language":"en","similar_titles":[1534152,138099,1506258,1453511,137568,162771,139241,1249832,1583797,1152541,1195868,191695,1501613,1439251,1186053,1317405,1392085,138100,1359294,137567,1249833,1359256,520757,1627789,195833],"networks":null,"network_names":[],"relevance_percentile":99.99,"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE8HIsIrq4o","trailer_thumbnail":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/video_thumbnails/764141_pthumbnail_320.jpg","sources":[{"source_id":203,"name":"Netflix","type":"sub","region":"US","ios_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","android_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","web_url":"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81309354","format":"HD","price":null,"seasons":null,"episodes":null}]}],[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/c7VbRPlev1bRfKvTxr98erw5T7B.jpg","belongs_to_collection":{"id":137696,"name":"Monsters, Inc.

John Goodman (Sully) and Billy Crystal (Mike) make for an outstanding duo in the lead roles, they are truly perfect for their respective roles.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, you have the excellent Steve Buscemi portraying Randall to terrific effect. There are also memorable roles for James Coburn (Waternoose), Jennifer Tilly (Celia) and Bob Peterson (Roz). You, of course, also have Boo (Mary Gibbs) who is simply adorable.\r\n\r\nEverything else from the plot to the animation is fantastic, too - I have no faults with this film. Funny, wholesome, entertaining and touching. I see they're creating a television series, <em>'Monsters at Work'</em>, which could be good given it will have the same cast.\r\n\r\nA must-watch!","created_at":"2020-07-17T23:59:03.556Z","id":"5f123b47b87aec00331a483a","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:40.834Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f123b47b87aec00331a483a"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1259801,"title":"Monsters, Inc.","original_title":"Monsters, Inc.","plot_overview":"James Sullivan and Mike Wazowski are monsters, they earn their living scaring children and are the best in the business... even though they're more afraid of the children than they are of them.

I very much enjoy it, especially the location of the finale.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks is again fabulous as Woody, while Tim Allen (Buzz) & Co. remain as entertaining as before. They also introduce some cool new characters, with the standout being Jessie who is voiced astutely by Joan Cusack; Jessie's backstory is so well done. Al (Wayne Knight) and Pete (Kelsey Grammer) are good additions, too.\r\n\r\nThere are some tremendous scenes here, that one for Cusack's character and the conclusion are my favourites alongside the ultra satisfying restoration scene; the end credits are amusing, also. It's all fun.\r\n\r\nThe other two sequels are brilliant, but this is the pick of the three. I'd highly recommend, evidently.","created_at":"2020-06-28T16:11:54.654Z","id":"5ef8c14a5b950800362bedfc","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:39.894Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5ef8c14a5b950800362bedfc"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Now that \"Woody\" and \"Buzz\" have well and truly buried the hatchet - and not in each other, they both hope owner \"Andy\" will take them to his summer camp with him. Sadly, though, \"Woody\" has hurt his arm - so is left behind, only to narrowly escape being sold in a car boot sale. Worryingly, though, he is spotted there by toy museum owner \"McWiggin\" and is promptly kidnapped! It now falls to \"Buzz\", \"Mr Potato Head\" and the rest of the gang to track him down and spring him, with his new friend \"Jessie\" before they are sold to a collector in Japan. Not all of the toys are on board though - and poor old \"Woody\" has to be wary of the double-dealing \"Prespector\" whilst \"Buzz\" finds that, unlike his abducted friend, he is not exactly unique! There are now plenty of fun escapades for all concerned to keep this high quality animation entertaining. That said, I don't really do sentimentality, and I found this to be a little more so than the first one. The introduction of \"Jessie\" accompanied by the rather sad story of her abandonment (set to an equally sad song) did drag the pace down a bit for me, but when the action kicks in again, then we revert to a first-rate, team-driven and wittily written tale of camaraderie, loyalty and ingenuity. Messrs. Hanks, Allen and Rickles keep up their established good work, this time joined by Joan Cusack and an on form Kelsey Grammer as \"Prospector\". It could be argued that the first \"Toy Story\" film was a marketing man's wet dream; this second feature is very nearly as good and demonstrates the enduring and engaging nature of the characters who value each other above all. Rare for a sequel to rival the original, but this gives it a good try!","created_at":"2022-06-15T16:01:25.320Z","id":"62aa02553d4d96341d5cca82","updated_at":"2022-06-15T16:01:25.320Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62aa02553d4d96341d5cca82"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1438467,"title":"Toy Story 2","original_title":"Toy Story 2","plot_overview":"Andy heads off to Cowboy Camp, leaving his toys to their own devices.

The stylized approach with the black and white filter and film grain was a bold choice that gave the movie great atmosphere and nostalgia. Werewolf by Night embraced the horror genre and violence slightly more than other Marvel movies, with villains losing limbs and being eaten. However, it’s still a Disney+ special at the end of the day, so I wouldn’t call it particularly scary or violent. As a fan of Elsa Bloodstone in the comics, I enjoyed her character’s role and backstory in the movie, which connected this isolated creature feature to a greater universe. The creative choices, great but not overdone effects, the introduction of new heroes, and the horror approach make Werewolf by Night one of the best recent entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","created_at":"2022-10-08T04:24:47.507Z","id":"6340fb8f6f97460082cbc6db","updated_at":"2022-10-08T04:24:47.600Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6340fb8f6f97460082cbc6db"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":2730876,"title":"Werewolf by Night","original_title":"Werewolf by Night","plot_overview":"On a dark and somber night, a secret cabal of monster hunters emerge from the shadows and gather at the foreboding Bloodstone Temple following the death of their leader.

some research, I find that women’s boxing rounds last just two minutes; that is, they are one minute shorter than in men’s boxing. That’s exactly how Catch the Fair One feels – like something’s missing. The ending is particularly frustrating, not because of how it plays out, but rather because it comes too soon – like a prize fight that concludes earlier than expected because one of the boxers has a glass jaw and gets, using Chris Tucker’s words from Friday, KTFO; the difference here is that it is the film, co-written and directed by Josef Kubota Wladyka, that KOs itself.\r\n\r\nWithout revealing the specifics, let’s just say that there is nothing inherently wrong with an climax wherein pretty much everybody bites the dust; in fact, the greatest tragedies – i.e., Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet – end up with high body counts. However, even in death, we are left with the impression that the characters achieve something; Romeo and Juliet, for instance, manage to reconcile Capulets with Montagues, no less.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, CtFO leaves us hanging – wondering, ‘is this it?’. I’m not saying the movie should have a happy ending, because that’s probably the only way to make matters worse; on the other hand, even a happy ending would be an ending. To continue employing boxing terms, what happens here is more akin to a referee stoppage than any sort of cathartic resolution. By way of comparison, Rocky actually loses to Apollo Creed at the end of the original Rocky, and he still manages to come out triumphant. In that sense, I’m thinking CtFO would have benefitted from an ending along the lines of that of Promising Young Woman – in which the heroine’s sacrifice actually means something.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, the reason to watch CtFO is Kali Reis’s performance as Kaylee ‘K.O.’ Uppeshau, a woman so tough she sleeps with a razorblade in her mouth. Reis is a real-life boxer who gets a ‘story-by’ credit in CtFO, thus singlehandedly doing more to subvert the ‘dumb jock’ stereotype than most sports movies – or, for that matter, than most athletes (Kyrie Irving, the NBA player/flat-earther, or Aaron Rodgers, the vaccine-averse NFL quarterback come immediately to mind, but the examples are Legion). And for what it’s worth, this is a much better (that is to say, it’s a lot shorter) film about a female boxer than, say, Million Dollar Baby – the advantage of a rushed ending is that the movie at least doesn’t take more than two and half hours to eventually go nowhere, even if nowhere is where we wind up regardless.","created_at":"2022-08-28T06:43:31.214Z","id":"630b0e93ca7ec6007efd6a47","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:32:39.706Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630b0e93ca7ec6007efd6a47"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1636917,"title":"Catch

SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/no-time-to-die-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"No Time To Die is the most emotional, personal James Bond movie of Daniel Craig's Era, holding a heartfelt farewell to the now-iconic actor. Delivering his best performance as 007, Craig finishes his memorable run in a high-stakes film with some of the best action sequences of the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the practical sets and locations, stunt work, cinematography, and editing are all no short of impressive, working together beautifully to create magnificent set pieces.\r\n\r\nDespite an overlong runtime with an exposition-heavy second act and a terribly stereotyped villain with unclear motivations, the emotionally compelling narrative sets up a powerful third act boosted by an epic score.\r\n\r\nCary Joji Fukunaga brilliantly directs a movie packed with phenomenal performances that will leave no viewer indifferent. Massive praise to the outstanding ensemble cast.\r\n\r\nAnd a humble thank you to Craig… Daniel Craig.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2021-10-02T15:21:23.647Z","id":"615878f3dd731b0042adc7a0","updated_at":"2021-10-02T15:21:23.647Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/615878f3dd731b0042adc7a0"},{"author":"RADIO1'S MR.

It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another “standard” comic book villain a’ la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies. I certainly am and, not surprisingly, the kids liked it as well.","created_at":"2018-01-23T06:08:46.790Z","id":"5a66d16ec3a3680cfb006191","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:04.270Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5a66d16ec3a3680cfb006191"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**A long form review originally posted in 2015:**\r\n\r\nI’ve just returned from two back-to-back viewings of _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, and I do not regret one bit going in for that second helping.\r\n\r\nI lost my steam on the _Age of Ultron_ wagon at a very inopportune moment. About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time, that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at. The combination of the market-saturation and the fact that the _Ultron _hype-train has been running for literally years, with a first trailer dropping seven months before the damn thing came out, meant I got weary of the thing just a fraction too soon. But I’m a sucker for the MCU, and there was no way I was missing the sequel to my favourite superhero movie of all time.\r\n\r\nI won’t harp on too much, because I don’t want to spoil anything (especially given that the movie isn’t even out in most parts of the world), I will put out a spoilertalk on this blog at some point down the line, but for now just let me leave you with a couple of quick thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Age of Ultron_ is not the best film of all time. It’s not the best superhero film of all time, it’s not even the best MCU film. Honestly, I personally feel it’s not even the best MCU Phase 2 film. But it is still good. And that’s what’s important here. But what do I mean by that? \r\n\r\nWell, for starters, in and of itself, I loved it, a breach past an 80% approval rating from me is no small thing. The things we enjoyed from the first _Avengers_are here. The mesmerising action spectacles of course, but I more mean the character moments we got between the Avengers themselves, that was my favourite part of the first film and we get it here again in spades. \r\n\r\nEvery new thing Joss has added to the plate works splendidly as well, real Hawkeye story, new heroes, a new villain, an updated world, all of these things are big ticks in lots of boxes.\r\n\r\nSo if everything from _The Avengers_ works and everything they’ve added works great too, why is _Age of Ultron_ not a perfect film? For spoiler-free purposes I will not go into detail, but that’s okay because the answer is quite simple: Everything in _Age of Ultron_ is great. It’s what’s not in _Age of Ultron_ that’s the problem.\r\n\r\nJoss Whedon said that the film had to be cut by nearly an hour. That way you get more showings in, and that means more money. Now I’m not saying we need every minute of that hour back, but what we ended up being left with, was just enough for _Age of Ultron_ to be the _Thor: The Dark World_ of the _Avengers _franchise (it was a far superior film to _Dark World_, but hear me out). _Age of Ultron_ is little more than a holding pattern. The set-ups for future films take up too much time for the story to bear the weight of some actual story, but everything that occurs in the film itself somehow also has virtually no consequence on world it is a part of. I can’t say it more plainly than that: It’s a holding pattern. It introduces some stuff, but it doesn’t stand alone the first film did. It’s not such a big deal when the solo-movies do that (like the aforementioned _Dark World_) because we have _The Avengers_ films for those to pay off in. But when an _Avengers_ entry is just more of the same, I can’t fully get behind it.\r\n\r\nThat all said, _Age of Ultron_ is of course a lot of fun. A huge amount of fun, I can’t state that enough. And there’s literally nothing more important something in the entertainment industry can be. These are just the things holding it back from taking it up to the next level (or if I’m being completely honest, even taking it to the level the first film was at).\r\n\r\n75%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_","created_at":"2018-06-05T11:49:43.675Z","id":"5b1678d7c3a3685352018aad","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:09.355Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b1678d7c3a3685352018aad"},{"author":"tmdb44006625","author_details":{"name":"","username":"tmdb44006625","avatar_path":null,"rating":5.0},"content":"The fact that Joss Whedon was able to salvage some sort of coherent film out of all he was forced to cram into a single movie is quite commendable. But the sad fact is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is really just a run of the mill \"bad guy wants to destroy the world for reasons\" actioner that we've seen done better many times before.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. The movie's fun. The dialogue is frequently clever and humourous. And I really appreciated the quiet bits of storytelling that Whedon was able to sneak in. It's just that at the end of the day, the villain is weak sauce, there's way too much set up for other movies, and if I'm criticizing Man of Steel for having excessive destruction, I can't give Avengers a pass since they needlessly blow up not one, not two, but three cities.

It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.\r\n\r\nYou jump - I jump.\r\n\r\nTitanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.\r\n\r\nNever let go.\r\n\r\nSo may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10","created_at":"2014-09-25T23:52:44.706Z","id":"5424aaccc3a36808760043df","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:28.766Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5424aaccc3a36808760043df"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS \"Titanic\", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young \"Dawson\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy \"Rose\" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée \"Hockley\" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother \"Ruth\" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, \"Rose\" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young \"Dawson\" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer \"Lovejoy\" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older \"Rose\" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television.","created_at":"2022-06-08T11:59:42.608Z","id":"62a08f2e12197e565ea45214","updated_at":"2022-06-08T11:59:42.608Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62a08f2e12197e565ea45214"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}},{"id":1434738,"title":"Titanic","original_title":"Titanic","plot_overview":"101-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater tells the story of her life aboard the Titanic, 84 years later.

Throughout all of its ups and downs, Don Mancini and the gang have never failed to bring forward a watchable movie. Even the most recent entry, _Cult of Chucky_ (which was kind of a fuck-up) provided me great enjoyment as a series-long fan. But no subsequent movie has ever matched the original for me. That first _Child's Play_ didn't just birth a classic character, it is, in and of itself, a classic. The first time you see Chucky open his mouth and hear the words of the real Brad Douriff... I've seen it twenty times over, and I'm still floored every single one of them. Absolutely floored, and floored with a massive grin on my face to boot.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it.

Of course there is loads of accompanying merchandise, but his widowed mother \"Karen\" (Catherine Hicks) has to make ends meet so the newly released doll is just too expensive for the young lad's birthday. Luckily for her, her pal \"Maggie\" (Dinah Manoff) finds a street pedlar who has one for a mere $30 and so she takes it home to the delight of the youngster. Unbeknown to everyone though, this rather ugly looking lump of plastic has been possessed by the demonic soul of \"Charles Lee Ray\" - a pretty brutal strangler who ended up being blown to bits in an explosion at a toy shop whilst being pursued by detective \"Norris\" (Chris Sarandon). When an unfortunate accident befalls poor old \"Maggie\", the boy discovers the truth and tries to explain the malevolence of his new toy to the grown ups, but they are sceptical. Until, that is, the mum discovers that \"Chucky\" manages to function remarkably well - without his Duracells - and soon she and the police officer are on their own toy- hunt! Despite only being about a foot tall, this doll is remarkably effective with a knife as he seeks vengeance on all who have betrayed him, and to involve \"Andy\" in his plan to stop himself becoming mortal and vulnerable. It's quite entertaining this, but not in the least scary. I found the young Vincent really got on my nerves after a few scenes and the story really doesn't have much substance to it. The camerawork tries hard to introduce a sense of menace, but the late 1980s synthesised soundtrack put me constantly on the lookout for \"Crockett\" or \"Tubbs\". It is short and the action, once we get going, comes thick and fast - but I found this all rather comedic and the ending, frankly, rather daft. Still, I can't say I hated it. It is quite a fun watch.","created_at":"2022-09-17T11:38:09.744Z","id":"6325b1a18d22fc0082bc3b6c","updated_at":"2022-09-17T11:38:09.819Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6325b1a18d22fc0082bc3b6c"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":173704,"title":"Child's

Unfortunately, the dog isn't the most artificial element of the movie.\r\n\r\nBesides being expectedly childish, incredibly formulaic, and exaggerated in every possible way, the characters and the main narrative are far from looking, sounding, and being authentic.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's a disappointingly hollow adaptation that kids will inevitably love, but adults will find it hard to endure.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C-","created_at":"2021-12-15T22:19:18.029Z","id":"61ba69e6c15f890064ca42e4","updated_at":"2021-12-15T22:19:18.029Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61ba69e6c15f890064ca42e4"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1565142,"title":"Clifford the Big Red Dog","original_title":"Clifford the Big Red Dog","plot_overview":"As Emily struggles to fit in at home and at school, she discovers a small red puppy who is destined to become her best friend.

When a threat in the form of creatures known as Druun arrive and threaten to destroy everything; the Dragons combine their power to defeat them but in doing so all but one of the Dragons remains.\r\n\r\nIn the new Disney animated film “Raya and the Last Dragon”; audiences are introduced to the narrative of the story by Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), who tells that the world has become fractured and she is to blame. A sacred relic that the Dragons used to Defeat the Druun has given her kingdom prosperity but the surrounding kingdoms all named after various parts of a Dragon are envious of their position.\r\n\r\nWhen Raya’s father Chief Benja (Daniel Dae Kim); attempts to unite the other kingdoms, a tragic betrayal results in the relic becoming fractured with each kingdom taking a fragment. As if this situation was not bad enough; the fracturing of the relic ushers in the return of the Druun and they quickly resume turning everything not protected by a barrier of water to stone.\r\n\r\nThe story then jumps years into the future where Raya and her faithful companion Tuk Tuk (Alan TudyK) are searching the rivers of the kingdoms in an effort to find the location where the last Dragon Sisu (Awkwafina) is rumored to have been sleeping for 500 years.\r\n\r\nRaya is eventually able to locate Sisu who is a very playful and animated creature and the two set off to save the day by obtaining the missing fragments through any means necessary. Naturally, their journey will be filled with dangers, adventure, and humor, as the various kingdoms have their own unique visual style and characters; some of whom join with Raya on her quest to provide much-needed support, perspective, and at times; humor.\r\n\r\nThe movie is visually amazing as the artists clearly were inspired to create a world that combines elements of many Asian cultures yet has its own unique traits. I marveled at the details of the water and ripples and how the railings on a boat showed uneven discoloration and wear in just a casual scene where the characters talked. It is this attention to detail that really adds to the magic of the film as well as the immersion into fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast was great and there are some characters I do not wish to spoil who practically steals every scene in which they are in.  My wife and I were captivated from the very start as Disney has created a film that embodies much of their classic themes and yet expands upon them to create a film the entire family will enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe movie will be released in cinemas and via a paid option for Disney+ subscribers. We attended a press screening at a cinema; our first in almost a year and found the setup to be very safe and it was amazing to see such visual splendor on a big screen.\r\n\r\nDisney has once again created a new classic and has given audiences the magic that they are known for at a time when it is most needed.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5.","created_at":"2021-03-01T17:10:51.977Z","id":"603d201b33a533004bd1906e","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:52.498Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/603d201b33a533004bd1906e"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nDisney purchased Pixar way back in 2006, and many incredible animated films have been released under both banners. Therefore, it’s quite understandable that many people don’t recognize the difference between Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar itself. The latter studio released two movies just last year (Onward, Soul), while the former’s latest original film dates back to 2016’s Moana. So, there was a lot of anticipation for a new animated movie from the studio that gave us classics such as Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, and more recently, the Frozen saga. With Don Hall (Big Hero 6) and Carlos López Estrada (Blindspotting) at the helm, and Adele Lim (Crazy Rich Asians) and Qui Nguyen (feature-film debut) tackling the screenplay, did they succeed in delivering a good film?\r\n\r\nWell, if I must answer “yes” or “no”, I’ll go with the first one. Let’s start with the positives. The one thing everyone expects from a Disney animated movie is beautiful animation, and Raya and the Last Dragon features tons of gorgeous, creative, jaw-dropping sceneries. The different lands that the story takes the viewers through look impressively realistic, some of them clearly drawing inspiration from real Asian places and culture. The character drawings also look excellent, even though they’re not too far from what we’ve seen from 3D animation in the last few years. \r\n\r\nTechnically though, my standout goes to James Newton Howard’s addictive, chill-inducing score. From the emotional tracks to the riveting tones that elevate every action sequence, it’s a score that I’ll struggle to get out of my head for the next couple of weeks, especially its main theme. In fact, I’m actually listening to it while writing this review, and I’m feeling full of energy. The sound effects for the Druun monsters are pretty eerie, it’s hard not to feel the weight of their threatening presence, but the inspirational, tear-inducing soundtracks leave me floored. The action scenes are wonderfully shot and animated, bringing high levels of entertainment and excitement to a partially adventure-driven narrative. Raya’s sword fighting is indisputably the most captivating type of battle seen throughout the entire runtime.\r\n\r\nStory-wise is where things get a little disappointing, to be completely honest. While the visuals share outstanding imagination and creativity, Adele Lim and Qui Nguyen’s formulaic screenplay is much more straightforward and unsurprising than expected. I knew Raya and the Last Dragon wasn’t going to deliver a groundbreaking narrative, but a videogame-style script is far from being a good alternative. The third act tries to challenge its story’s predictability with one little unexpected moment that I undoubtedly love, but besides not changing the outcome predicted in the first ten minutes of the film, it severely damages a secondary character.\r\n\r\nRegarding this last issue, I can’t deny that it’s my main problem with the movie, but I would have to go into spoiler territory to fully explain it. Therefore, I’ll only address the character’s inconsistency, which unfortunately affects the film’s primary message. The main themes revolve around trust and how if we treat other people kindly, they’ll treat us in the same way. A lovely note that parents will surely want to transmit to their kids, without the shadow of a doubt. However, the character in question spends the movie not knowing where to stand, constantly betraying everyone, and even blaming others for something that same character triggered in the first place.\r\n\r\nDespite having a significantly negative impact on my enjoyment of the film, the ending does work quite well and compensates for my problem with the said character. Kelly Marie Tran lends her voice to Raya, a protagonist easy to root for due to her clear motivations and important mission, while Awkwafina is very funny as Sisu, a goofy dragon with more depth than what the viewers might expect from the first impression. Everyone in the cast delivers extraordinary voice work, and every character has some sort of captivating trait that makes the audience support them, except for you know who. Having in mind that kids are indeed the target audience, I’m positive all will feel delighted with this movie.\r\n\r\nBoasting a predominantly Asian American cast, all delivering exceptional voice work, Raya and the Last Dragon follows a partially disappointing, formulaic narrative but compensates it with stunning animation, a chill-inducing score, and quite a nice ending. Walt Disney Animation Studios returns with an original story that lacks surprising elements, lending all the creativity and imagination to its entertaining, fast-paced adventure packed with undeniably impactful visuals and incredibly riveting action sequences. Despite a significant problem with an inconsistent character that profoundly affects my enjoyment of the film, all other characters are extremely likable, goofy, and well-written. A delightful message about trust and treating others kindly is ultimately well-transmitted to the viewers, which I hope parents will show their kids. Final remark: James Newton Howard’s score will not leave your minds for a long, long time.\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2021-03-01T17:13:07.315Z","id":"603d20a3e267de005151480c","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:52.501Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/603d20a3e267de005151480c"},{"author":"SWITCH.","author_details":{"name":"SWITCH.","username":"maketheSWITCH","avatar_path":"/klZ9hebmc8biG1RC4WmzNFnciJN.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"'Raya and the Last Dragon' is a solid step back in the right direction for Walt Disney Animation Studios. Over the past 20 years, they've struggled to find their confidence and voice as a studio, certainly due to complicated changes of leadership and the rise of genuine artistic and financial competitors, but 'Raya' is the kind of film in which they do their best work - an entertaining and exciting experience built on a strong protagonist with a clear motivation and a powerful internal conflict. The legacy of Disney animation has been to speak to the deep emotional truths of the human experience in a way that is accessible to anyone, and with its themes of self-belief, moving through grief and trauma, and finding the trust in others and ourselves, 'Raya and the Last Dragon' is a worthy part of that legacy.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-raya-and-the-last-dragon-a-solid-return-to-form-for-walt-disney-animation-studios","created_at":"2021-03-08T02:20:27.149Z","id":"604589ebca0e17007648b76b","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:52.757Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/604589ebca0e17007648b76b"},{"author":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","author_details":{"name":"Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots","username":"screenzealots","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/70d4177132896d293b72f4c595521141.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"It’s terrific to see the animated movies continuing to evolve, and “Raya and the Last Dragon” is the latest film that takes the traditional idea of a Disney heroine and makes a huge leap into a welcome new direction. This magical fantasy / adventure tale features inspired characters, beautiful animation, and a culturally accurate representation of Asian mythology. It’s a terrific movie on all levels.\r\n\r\nLong ago in the make-believe world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. There was a complete balance to the world until an evil force known as the Druun began to threaten the land. This sinister tribe of shadow monsters rose to power by feeding off the discord of humans, and the dragons decided to sacrifice themselves to save all of humanity. New unrest nearly 500 years later has resulted in the five divided lands of the kingdom refusing to co-exist in peace, giving rise to the Druun once again. Determined to preserve the world she loves, lone warrior Raya (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran) decides to track down the last living dragon and use its magic to save Kumandra.\r\n\r\nRaya is a trailblazing heroine, and she’s one that’s easy to admire and love. Her determination never falters as she learns the value of teamwork and trust along her journey. The film’s main characters are all female, from the last dragon Sisu (voiced by Awkwafina) to Raya’s adversary Namaari (voiced by Gemma Chan). There’s a magical relationship between Sisu and Raya, two unlikely friends that discover in each other that exactly little spark that each of their lives were missing. Even better, Raya collects a group of misfits along her journey, reinforcing the idea that heroes can come from the most unlikely places.\r\n\r\nThe film’s group of directors (Don Hall, Carlos López Estrada, Paul Briggs, and John Ripa) has created original characters that are unlike others you’ve seen before, and the beautiful animation brings them to life. Sisu is a gorgeous pastel-hued dragon with a personality to match (Awkwafina is the MVP in the cast). Raya is a new kind of Disney “princess,” one who knows how to take charge and can kick butt. There’s so much for everyone to love here, even if some of the goofier gags (like a thieving baby who is far more irritating than cute) may take viewers out of the overall experience.\r\n\r\nThe story is exciting and the elements of mythical adventure are spirited, making “Raya and the Last Dragon” one of the more interesting films to come out of Disney in a while. It’s an animated feature with a positive, sincere message, lively action scenes, and a sweet tale of friendship that can be enjoyed by the entire family.","created_at":"2021-03-09T15:44:16.569Z","id":"604797d0ea37e00045400a6b","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:53.011Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/604797d0ea37e00045400a6b"},{"author":"davidfortoday","author_details":{"name":"","username":"davidfortoday","avatar_path":null,"rating":null},"content":"Disney, like many studios, have been under a lot of pressure to produce not only a large quantity of content but it also needs a higher level of quality. There was a clear need for something new under the Disney brand that wasn’t just a remake from something in the 90s and I believe Raya was a ray of sunshine to the studio. The ability to maintain the same family friendly message while still allowing animation to touch the hearts of any viewer was such an amazing feat. In order to avoid any spoilers I’ll just say the journey of Raya is not only inspirational but empowering. This is certainly a win for the studio and for any viewer that gives it a chance.","created_at":"2021-04-21T03:53:18.339Z","id":"607fa1ae8b959e00581a45eb","updated_at":"2021-06-23T17:03:32.083Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/607fa1ae8b959e00581a45eb"},{"author":"Kamurai","author_details":{"name":"Kamurai","username":"Kamurai","avatar_path":"/sKeC7qZLAKreuwxH4x6U3mN7Aa8.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.\r\n\r\nI heard a lot of noise about it being a rip off of this, or a rip off of that, long short that it was a non-original cash-grab.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't see what people were talking about, other than it was an Asian-ish themed animation, and those people are just unfamiliar with Eastern anime, poor things.\r\n\r\nThis feels like an untold, if not unique, world, mythology, and great characters.\r\n\r\nMy big problem with this movie is that it is fueled by stupid.  I honestly expected them to fight over the magic thing, but the incompetence of stealing a thing that keeps the world from ending, let alone breaking it into pieces is a bit much.  It actually pushes it over into a horror movie territory, and it shows at one point.\r\n\r\nThere was also the bit where they show us a movie they skipped before this one, but it may not have been the best to start a franchise.\r\n\r\nThis movie feels like an old timey fable, it gets dark, and there is a lesson to be learned.\r\n\r\nI found it full of fun, adventure and action, not to mention top quality animation.  It is well worth the watch.","created_at":"2021-06-13T18:37:40.495Z","id":"60c6507448333a0057570e7f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:56.861Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60c6507448333a0057570e7f"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Me and the kids watched this movie, one of the latest works of Disney, the other evening. I am pleased to be able to write that we found it quite good actually.\r\n\r\nIt is always with some worry that I approach anything that comes from Disney these days given how their woke brigade have screwed things over lately. This movie however, seems to be more or less back to old and working recipes and free from (too much) woke nonsense. Maybe Disney execs have finally realized that letting the woke brigade, SJW’s and cancel culture have any say whatsoever in the creative processes hurts the bottom line.\r\n\r\nIt is a good adventure story surrounded by lots of colorful characters, great scenery and lovely animated creatures. Just how a animated Disney movie should be. Some, probably self proclaimed, culture elite called it a “mediocre and repetitive story”. That is just such a load of bullshit but unfortunately the stupid algorithms on IMDb’s website calls it a “top review” and puts it on the front page of the movie (which is why I noticed it). Given that the movie currently hold a 7.4 rating on IMDb, 81% on TMDb and even the usually useless Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating well above 90% I’d say this bloke is a minority.\r\n\r\nRaya herself was quite likable but her main adversary was rather bland in my opinion. However, the characters surrounding Raya was making up for this. I quite liked Boun, I definitely liked Tong and I just loved the baby and the three small rascals causing mischief everywhere they went.\r\n\r\nThe dragons where okay, Sisu was rather fun but they were all more like cuddly pets than real dragons with any real powers except for some parlor tricks. I did like the ending with all the Dragons being back though.\r\n\r\nIn good Disney tradition there were plenty of side characters and environmental gadgets etc… that threw in some additional laughs here and there.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote above, this was pretty much what would expect from Disney, the good Disney that we used to know that made fun movies for all ages.","created_at":"2021-08-07T12:31:46.200Z","id":"610e7d32dcf8750060754f8d","updated_at":"2021-08-07T12:31:46.200Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/610e7d32dcf8750060754f8d"},{"author":"SpotaMovie.com","author_details":{"name":"SpotaMovie.com","username":"bastag","avatar_path":"/h9FkucYmSN3YH5OmrNRWO5rdquS.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"**Introduction by SpotaMovie.com**\r\nDisney delivers another movie f**ull of adventure, colours and essential messages.

I mean, how couldn't it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. It's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nI'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there's something I'm not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger's. That's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same \"version\" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let's switch to Phoenix since he's the star of this show … He has 2019's best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I'm sure he'll get that Oscar. I hope so! It's so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). \"The world is getting crazier out there\", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur’s personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.\r\n\r\nIt's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can't remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax … I got chills all over my body. They couldn't have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just… there.\r\n\r\nA Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I'm listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.\r\n\r\nRegarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don't know what to say. It's ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater \"happy\" or \"joyful\", then at least one of the film's message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!\r\n\r\nNowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true?\r\n\r\nAll in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Guðnadóttir's score and Lawrence Sher's cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant!\r\n\r\nPS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.\r\n\r\nRating: A","created_at":"2019-10-04T14:44:13.190Z","id":"5d975abdae26be001abe129b","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:27.606Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d975abdae26be001abe129b"},{"author":"solstafir7","author_details":{"name":"","username":"solstafir7","avatar_path":null,"rating":null},"content":"Joker. The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more.\r\n\r\nTodd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just above the crop. It is appropriately crazy and completely focussed on the central character. The narrator goes close to the shores of that craziness, wets his feet but remains dry to tell this story. It is like those news reporters which go closer to the burning amazon, but it is impossible to step in the fumes. In no way, Joker is telling his story. Instead, his story is told to us and there are pillars of sanity (like the detectives, asylum clerk etc.) which remain steadfast to give a strong anchor to the audience. This dilutes the effect of the film.\r\n\r\nWith the copious amount of material on Joker already, I wished to consider this film as a standalone character study vaguely inspired by the batman universe. But this is not entirely possible. I was forced to think about it on two levels. With Batman and Without Batman. \r\n\r\nWith Batman, The Joker is on the home turf. There have been many renditions of Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal is still vivid in my mind. I knew that Arthur here will go on to become someone who is going to say, “‎Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...”. When I was thinking Joker in the context of Batman, I could not keep Ledger's joker too far away. I was searching for a path for Arthur to go from the mentally unstable to the calculating anarchist. I was left searching for that path when the movie ended. To remain as the crown prince of crime, and to justify the title of the greatest adversary of Batman, just mental instability isn't good enough. He needs to be much more intelligent, much more cunning. These traits are often visible early, In the case of Arthur, I could not find that complete foundation upon which the later psyche can stand. This reminded me of Cameron Monaghan's Jerome Valeska. The joker of my understanding is somewhere between the cruelty of Jerome and pitiable delusions of Arthur. Also, the iconic Batman moment was not needed in this. I kept feeling that Joker is trying to stand with the support of Batman's tale as a clutch. A safety net enforced by the producers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I consider this movie as a standalone tale, then it was a bit more satisfying. There are tearjerker movies where nothing good ever happens with the protagonist. A series of bad lucks, or difficulties keep blocking a normal life. He is most definitely poor, has a sub-optimal family background, has a medical affliction which is unique and provides a foundation of the pity I felt. This is not very far from Rani Mukharjee's Hichki if you only consider the medical condition. Rani's Naina had Tourette syndrome while Joaquin's Arthur suffers from pseudobulbar affect. The setting and genre make the two films vastly different. More often than not, I have noticed these disorders lift a lot of burden from the narrative. In the case of Joker, couple his disorder with usually being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you have a travesty of human life. Add to that, an unstable parent, amplify it with the volatile societal conditions, you have a perfect decoction of what Joker is made of. As a tale of its own, it works. The delivery is great thanks to the spectacular performance. It also helps to increase the awareness of mental health. But when you strip off all the Batman context, it remains a well-acted and averagely written tale. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a single film, and I felt it is torn between these two polarising treatments. It wants to find its ground, which it finds. But that ground is far from being sensational. It remains somewhat indecisive. It can not be well soaked in Batman lore like James Gordon's tale, Gotham is. I am considering Gotham because both Gotham and Joker do not feature Batman, but they both have Bruce. Gotham understands its lore and fully embraces it but Joker does not want to. At the same time, as a tale of the psychologically troubled protagonist, Joker tries to play safe with the aim to please audience en-mass. I kept thinking about American Psycho and The Machinist. (Coincidently, both star ex-Batman Christian Bale). Those two take you in the psyche of the protagonist. Those take you inside the burning Amazon and not stand at a safe distance. Joker does not aim to do so. \r\n\r\nI am not at all qualified to talk about the acting performances. Joaquin Phoenix is in every frame and the way he waltzes between emotions is terrifyingly amazing. The Tai Chi to calm himself down, the menacing stare when finally becomes the Joker, those are chilling. He lives the character to the best of his abilities. Regrettably, he does not have the same level of writing support which Heath Ledger had and so due to no fault of his own, Joaquin could not topple Heath Ledger's portrayal of the crown prince of crime.\r\n\r\nIf I consider Todd Philips's entire resume, this was a genre shift for him. He knew very well that the biggest trump card is Joaquin Phoenix, so he takes no risk. He keeps him in focus, almost always all the setting and cinematography works for him. The only exception being Robert De Niro. Robert is allowed to carry his scenes quite independently. I think Todd Philips relied on both these giants to carry their parts. Sadly, I had gone to a theatre which had a bad print or screen so I think I will have to watch it again sometimes to enjoy the cinematography.\r\n\r\nI realised, I kept writing a lot and this is already over a thousand words. If you are here and reading still, I must say thank you. To summarise, The Joker worked for me and I enjoyed it, but I would not consider it the best depication of the iconic villain from comic books. The best may yet come.","created_at":"2019-10-20T10:18:11.465Z","id":"5dac3463174a870019a7c547","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:28.173Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5dac3463174a870019a7c547"},{"author":"ikomrad","author_details":{"name":"","username":"ikomrad","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b81ebdb950829a0af723b7daf360ef8d.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"The Joker is similar to the DC Joker character but is not a criminal genius.

So, I’ll just give my thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Joker” is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur’s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media is portrayed as a man of many dimensions, wealthy but caring, and instilling these values in his son Bruce. Here, he is portrayed as much more uncaring and elitist. Which gives much less of an impact in the inevitable alley scene we see in everything remotely related to Batman. More on this in a minute. It’s important to the point.\r\n\r\nArthur suffers a condition that makes him burst into laughter at inappropriate times. He also has other unspecified mental illnesses. We’re never given the specifics. This is actually a little troubling because of the general depiction of mental illness. It almost seems like they are saying that if someone is mentally ill then they are a ticking time bomb and it’s only a matter of time before they go off. This is not a good look.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of events, Arthur begins spiraling downward, but at the same time realizes how much influence he can have over other people, an aspect of the Joker that isn’t often explored. And this is where the characters other than Arthur being rather flat comes into play.\r\n\r\nThere’s more than one indication that we are actually witnessing these events through Arthur’s eyes. And this creates a brilliant depiction of a narcissistic personality. The only character that gets fully fleshed out is Arthur himself, but he can’t or won’t connect with other people to see their depth. As such, we get to see narcissism from the inside, no connection to others and in fact seeing them as pawns in his own schemes. It’s subtle and definitely not in your face, but if you look carefully, the hints are there.\r\n\r\nThose who fear that \"Joker\" would glorify incel violence or otherwise can rest a little easier, but as I mentioned, the film isn't without its troubling portrayals. It does vilify the mentally ill, which creates a whole host of other issues. The movie swings wildly between \"excellent\" and just \"okay,\" and sometimes even \"meh.\" As such, it gets a recommendation, but only a mild one.","created_at":"2019-11-24T00:24:53.294Z","id":"5dd9cdd528723c0014588c1f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:29.293Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5dd9cdd528723c0014588c1f"},{"author":"Leno","author_details":{"name":"Leno","username":"fLeno","avatar_path":"/vNPHnw6jgbERZmhNlDk3OwL9KgH.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"*A Masterpiece*.\r\n\r\nThe movie shows the escalating events that made Arthur become the Joker.

There’s also some dark humor in ‘Joker’ that involves a door chain. It’s silly, yet absolutely terrifying with the given context. A complete departure from his other work and that’s why I think it’s one of his best. I honestly think he made something so unique and meaningful. Seriously, I do.\r\n\r\nThe score by Hildur Guðnadóttir helped set the tone tremendously. A melancholy tone with a chaotic twist. A representation of Arthur slowly drowning in his own misery and pain. A little fun fact: The score for the film were written based on the script even before the actual filming of the movie started, which I think is the best way to do it, if you ask me. Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was gorgeous and there’s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty.\r\n\r\nI like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than “guy gets shot in alleyway”. He’s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He’s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it’s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody’s else perspective.\r\n\r\nThere’s a scene where Arthur goes to watch a comedy standup show to take notes on a comedians act. Every time a joke is told and everyone laughs, his face is frozen in place with an unsure grin while his eyes look around the room wondering why everyone’s laughing, but when the laughter dies down he jumps to live with a delayed laugh. It’s moments like that are simple, yet says a lot about him. Basically showing how disconnected he is with humor and everyone else.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie:\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. I mean, there probably has been incidents when somebody committed a horrendous crime because their were influenced by a movie or a game. However, it’s he/she that should be brought into question, not the creators. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If “Joker” is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. If people really care about how violence is portrayed in movies, then Rob Zombies ‘3 From Hell’ should also receive the same attention. Just imagine ‘Natural Born Killers’ times 100, but I guess it’s not mainstream enough for any of that. And sure, there’s some brutal and raw approach to violence in ‘Joker’, but we all have seen worst. ‘Deadpool’ is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer. People will never learn to stop pointing fingers at things to blame and actually do something about it! People often understandment how much power their got.\r\n\r\nAnywhere, sorry about that folks, just had to get that off my chest. Go and check it out.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: “Send in the clowns” ⇠ you’ve gotta sing that like Frank Sinatra.","created_at":"2020-01-27T18:07:32.017Z","id":"5e2f26e44ca676001249c3c2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:33.464Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5e2f26e44ca676001249c3c2"},{"author":"lamachat","author_details":{"name":"","username":"lamachat","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b7c58e60173cbc8a15558744a7b24831.jpg","rating":null},"content":"It is intersting to analyze this movie in a context of global increase of violent social movements against the Establishment.

As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.\r\n\r\nThe “Joker” in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.\r\n\r\nThe movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it’s qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that’s Hollywood today.\r\n\r\nThat the politically biased and elitist so called “critics” on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy “review” site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though. Epic fail as far as I am concerned.","created_at":"2020-02-19T19:30:02.315Z","id":"5e4d8cba283ed900195ccff2","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:34.194Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5e4d8cba283ed900195ccff2"},{"author":"Adam Rife","author_details":{"name":"Adam Rife","username":"AdamRife","avatar_path":"/9vaYFFgdkzacJ9hJpEnZWLp88if.jpg","rating":null},"content":"Joker made me laugh , cry , and made me feel scared . This movie isn't your run of the mill superhero flick this is a gritty  homage to that of films made by the great Martin Scorsese . Some scenes will have you in shock and awe without breaking away from what Arthur sees and feels as he lives in an 80's era Gotham living with <a href=\"https://paperhelp.nyc/\">paper help</a> and his mom and a mental disorder (Pseudobulbar affect if I'm not mistaken ) , the film also adds the unreliable narrator aspect ( where the camera can show you something that either isn't real or isn't happening), besides that the acting is phenomenal, Joaquin Phoenix really brings his A game, showing Arthur fleck as a loving, kind individual that just wants to make you laugh but is beaten down by an ever changing society that both beat him down and in the end breaks him. This movie also adds the idea of the \"one bad day\" theme from the killing joke comic where in the comic joker says and i quote '' all it takes is one bad day to bring the sanest man to lunacy \" and it takes that idea and brings it to the forefront. In conclusion I think joker was beyond amazing, between the acting, music score and set pieces it was a wild (and scary) ride . Symbolism also sneaks into the movie with slight things you wouldn't notice upon first watching . This movie leaves you confused on what was real and what wasn't . In the end between you and your spouse , friend , or family member will have reasons on what was real and what wasn't  and that's what made the movie even better for me , how it left me talking days after and like dark knight and iron man before this i believe that joker will change the superhero movie genre forever... send in the clowns 10/10 would see again","created_at":"2020-09-11T10:56:51.682Z","id":"5f5b57f3da10f00037917127","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:44.237Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f5b57f3da10f00037917127"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Each to their own, as always, but for me: Incredible!\r\n\r\nI was fully aware of <em>'Joker'</em> ever since its release, impossible not to be given the extraordinary hype that surrounded it, but it still absolutely surpassed my expectations - a sensational film. I adored every second of this; and I'm not even a Joker/DC Comics etc. 'fan'.\r\n\r\nJoaquin Phoenix gives an astonishingly outstanding performance as the titular character, undoubtedly one of the greatest showings that I've ever seen from an actor. I'm not one that takes notice of awards, but he is fully deserving of anything of that ilk that he won due to this. Quality!\r\n\r\nEverything else about the film is fantastic. Great score, great cinematography, great pacing... it's all just utterly superb and makes for a spectacular watch. I love that they avoided just going wall-to-wall crazy with this, don't get me wrong things get mad but there's more to it than just violence et al.\r\n\r\nI had presumed that I was going to enjoy this, but it honestly smashed any predictions I had about it before seeing it.

Needless to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien’s but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.\n\nStill, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.\n\nAnyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.\n\nThe story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.\n\nI have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping all the way to the finishing scenes that he would meet a gruesome end.\n\nOn the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a “Tolkienesque” athmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers.","created_at":"2018-01-06T16:18:55.469Z","id":"5a50f6ef0e0a26026f00c1bc","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:03.873Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5a50f6ef0e0a26026f00c1bc"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"Comparing the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy and the _Hobbit_ trilogy was already like comparing apples and mediocre oranges, but none so mediocre as _Battle of the Five Armies_. Don't get me wrong, I love a \"battle\" as much as the next guy, more maybe, I don't even mind a movie that's 95% battle, but in this? It does. Not. Work.\r\n\r\n_Five Armies_ is a movie that never made it out of pre-viz, let alone to a polished, well-rounded, final cut. I enjoy it to some degree when running through a Middle-Earth marathon as a whole, but only when the group I'm with will let me roll my eyes and complain about it.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._","created_at":"2019-01-20T14:05:54.128Z","id":"5c448042c3a3681a1124e058","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:16.151Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5c448042c3a3681a1124e058"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Exactly what it says on the tin - to a fault.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I like it. However, towards the end <em>'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'</em> definitely begins to drag quite heavily - the impact of what eventually happens did not, to be honest, hit as strongly as it could've/should've. The pure action is good, but there's not much to remember about everything else.\r\n\r\nNone of the characters, with the exception of Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Luke Evans (Bard) I guess, stand out amidst the wall-to-wall battle. Martin Freeman (Bilb), Ian McKellen (Gandalf) & Co. are are of little importance really, which is a shame.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Hobbit'</em> series, unfortunately, gets inferior as it goes by. Loved the first film, enjoyed the second but this third installment - while passable - leaves me with a feeling of wanting something else from it. Happy to have watched them though, I'd still recommend them for sure.","created_at":"2021-02-22T03:47:18.637Z","id":"6033294620ecaf003d17ff8e","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:52.144Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6033294620ecaf003d17ff8e"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1397223,"title":"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies","original_title":"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies","plot_overview":"Immediately after the events of The Desolation of Smaug, Bilbo and the dwarves try to defend Erebor's mountain of treasure from others who claim it: the men of the ruined Laketown and the elves of Mirkwood.

The animation is bright, the human cast delivers enjoyably goofy performances, and the film stays true to the original cartoon’s roots. It isn’t super funny nor creative, but the fun story about a celebrity wedding gone awry and a stuffy New York City hotel that employs a cat to rid them of a mouse problem lays the groundwork for a bit of amusing mayhem.\r\n\r\nBlending classic animation with live action, the effects are better than expected. The actors (including Chloë Grace Moretz, Michael Peña, Pallavi Sharda, and Colin Jost) do a great job interacting with their cat and mouse counterparts, and the cartoonish elements are reminiscent of the classic Tom and Jerry of the past. The story rekindles the rivalry between the two, but is updated for modern audiences.\r\n\r\nThe physical comedy and sight gags are good for most of the giggles, but that’s where the humor stops. There’s also a lot of unnecessary potty humor and a few questionable plot points (the movie does little to rise above certain stereotypes) that may feel cringe-worthy to some adults.\r\n\r\n“Tom and Jerry” isn’t noteworthy at all, but it’s not awful, either. There’s enough here to entertain most kids for a couple of hours.","created_at":"2021-03-09T15:42:27.392Z","id":"60479763c4ad590044e8dc85","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:53.004Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60479763c4ad590044e8dc85"},{"author":"SWITCH.","author_details":{"name":"SWITCH.","username":"maketheSWITCH","avatar_path":"/klZ9hebmc8biG1RC4WmzNFnciJN.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"The spirit of the old cartoons is nowhere to be seen here, and that's the biggest disappointment.

From the beloved classic Training Day to the highly entertaining The Equalizer films, Fuqua has demonstrated skillful handling of action sequences. As expected, Infinite delivers several fighting scenes and car chases, mostly riveting and quite enjoyable. The third act gets extremely over-the-top concerning the action set pieces, which are only tolerable due to a special yet underdeveloped character trait that ultimately justifies the more absurd moments. Mauro Fiore's camera work and Conrad Buff IV's editing are decent enough, but the last act features too much shaky cam and excessive cuts for my taste.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, that's where things get tricky. Ian Shorr's screenplay boasts a genuinely interesting premise with exciting world-building to support it. However, the tiresome voice-over from Mark Wahlberg - who offers a good performance just as the rest of the cast - holds heavy exposition that's then repeated in dialogues across the movie, stretching the runtime unnecessarily. This narration rarely adds anything relevant to the story or impacts the viewer's opinion about the protagonist.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, it's one of those films that carries tremendous storytelling potential but never reaches it. Personally, I truly find the concept intriguing, but its development doesn't leave the base of its premise. In fact, just by watching the main trailer, most of the world-building is given to the audience in those few minutes. Honestly, in better hands, this movie could have been the beginning of a new franchise with infinite - no pun intended- possibilities to make sequels, prequels, spin-offs, or even trigger the start of a TV show.\r\n\r\nAs it is, Infinite is nothing more than an inoffensively entertaining flick that could have been much, much better.\r\n\r\nRating: C","created_at":"2021-06-10T10:15:07.032Z","id":"60c1e62b2c6b7b002a428525","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:56.779Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60c1e62b2c6b7b002a428525"},{"author":"Kamurai","author_details":{"name":"Kamurai","username":"Kamurai","avatar_path":"/sKeC7qZLAKreuwxH4x6U3mN7Aa8.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Pretty good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI feel like I had a lot of problems with this movie.  The concept is good, but not very cinematic, so it feels like they tried to add action to \"Ad Astra\".  With Mark Wahlberg as the main protagonist, a lot of the movie, as I could think was \"Somwon stohl mah teddy bwear\" so that ruined the vibe a little.\r\n\r\nA large part of it is that the story takes place over centuries if not millenia, so clearly that's not part of the movie, so we miss out on caring about who these immortals are as characters.  You're sort of just told to care about them.\r\n\r\nFor at least part of the movie I identified with the villains more because their plan is actually laid out with some level of clarity and a surprising amount of reason: kill everyone and there is nowhere to resurrect.\r\n\r\nSort of a fun interpretation of \"When your enemy goes to ground, leave no ground to go to.\".\r\n\r\nUltimately this is a high end cast, with plenty of money behind the production, so it looks good, and has an interesting concept, but just sort of falls flat on the execution.  I just never really cared about the characters.","created_at":"2021-07-11T18:37:11.071Z","id":"60eb3a5729c626005ea6fb3c","updated_at":"2021-07-11T18:37:11.071Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60eb3a5729c626005ea6fb3c"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"This is one of those films that has a solution right from the get-go, as plain as the nose on your face that by the end, or maybe even the end of the beginning (as Churchill might have said) you would cheerfully have applied to yourself... Poor old \"Evan\" (Mark Wahlberg) has an amazing memory, but is constantly hassled by vivid hallucinations that are driving him towards a mental breakdown. Somehow, though, some semblance of sanity rears it's head leading \"Evan\" to wonder if is he part of a plan to destroy all of mankind, or is he part of the solution that may just save it from Chiwetel Ejiofor's \"Bathurst 2020\" (sadly, no, not the Aussie motor car race)? The plot itself is quite interesting, and the overlapping memories creating the terrifyingly unstable state of our hero could have made for a much better effort had director Antoine Fuqua not tried to cram far too much into 1¾ hours. The sacrifices to characterisation and detail, coupled with the relentlessness of the action scenes (that actually serve to sterilise the plot, somewhat) just leave us with way too many holes and a totally undercooked story. Wahlberg is well passed his best, and though Sophie Cookson tries hard as \"Nora\" the whole thing just gets lost in it's own maze of confusion and poorly adapted dialogue. Sadly another example of a film that threw money at the talent and the look, but scrimped on an intelligent screenplay.","created_at":"2022-03-27T18:46:32.110Z","id":"6240b108223a8b00941c719b","updated_at":"2022-03-27T18:46:32.110Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6240b108223a8b00941c719b"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3}},{"id":1563051,"title":"Infinite","original_title":"Infinite","plot_overview":"Evan McCauley has skills he never learned and memories of places he has never visited.

Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.\r\n\r\nForget the \"based on a true story\" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means \"this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit\". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.\r\n\r\nStory essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.\r\n\r\nThere is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.\r\n\r\nThe script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.\r\n\r\nMet with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10\r\n","created_at":"2014-06-17T00:34:54.270Z","id":"539f8d2e0e0a2650810003e5","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:26.871Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/539f8d2e0e0a2650810003e5"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror/haunted house/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting?\r\n\r\nThis is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nOne thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970′s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this “ghosthunter” make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.\r\n\r\nThe we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect.","created_at":"2014-06-17T06:09:33.754Z","id":"539fdb9dc3a36850d9000ef5","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:26.875Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/539fdb9dc3a36850d9000ef5"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"I'm a fan of Wan, and while I must say I believe that _The Conjuring_ is pretty severely overrated, it's also one of the best horror films to have hit the mainstream in the past few years.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._","created_at":"2017-11-28T02:15:10.638Z","id":"5a1cc6aec3a3680b9a062cc0","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:03.015Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5a1cc6aec3a3680b9a062cc0"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Hadn't seen this in a while and watching it again in preparation for the third movie, found it to be well done.

It doesn't take them long to realise that this whole area has been the scene of Satanic worship since time immemorial, and those lingering spirits have got it in for the new occupants of the house - and their five increasingly hysterical daughters. James Wan really does develop this story with an effective degree of menace and Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor work well together as the parents scared out of their pants by the goings-on in their dream home that is turning into a nightmare that perhaps even an exorcism won't resolve. Joseph Bishara presents us with an eerily effective musical accompaniment to this story and the acrobatic and prosthetic visual effects all contribute effectively to create a real sense of malevolence that, unusually for many in this genre - it has a degree of plausibility too. Big screen experience is better especially in a busy cinema, and well worth a watch.","created_at":"2022-09-08T14:40:33.824Z","id":"6319fee1002134007ae8b9da","updated_at":"2022-09-08T14:40:33.874Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6319fee1002134007ae8b9da"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":5}},{"id":1384594,"title":"The Conjuring","original_title":"The Conjuring","plot_overview":"Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren work to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in their farmhouse.

The chameleon character could have been more juicy and it also repeats with stubborn determination Disney's intent of making any other animal to behave like dogs.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it is a stereotypical Disney movie that nails the template but it does it so well that it is also really entertaining. In addition, they get to add some of the fresh characteristics brought by Shrek to the scene.","created_at":"2014-10-20T11:02:36.098Z","id":"5444ebccc3a3683e0e0073e5","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:29.293Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5444ebccc3a3683e0e0073e5"},{"author":"ohlalipop","author_details":{"name":"","username":"ohlalipop","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d43accfe23739fc82d4a51f04c51b70e.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Been wanting to watch this movie for quite some time. But then I wasn't sure if I really wanted to watch this or not because it might be just like Frog Prince (which I haven't seen completely yet). Even if I was tired (slept late the night before and woke up early when we got a phone call that Matt and Toby will come over to play Wii) and I didn't have money anymore, I wanted to watch this movie just to keep Matt entertained.\r\n\r\nI wasn't disappointed. I really like this movie. It was like a classic Disney movie: a Princess, her prince charming, animal sidekick, and the best of all, MUSIC! I liked how the Princess was not the typical Disney princess. Rapunzel was strong and active. She wasn't very timid and proper like the usual Disney princess that I grew up watching. Flynn Rider was really cute which was a big plus. He was really charming. The animal sidekicks, Mascal and Maximus, were funny. All in all, I really like this movie and I strongly recommend it to all.","created_at":"2017-02-09T10:09:15.949Z","id":"589c3fcb925141250a00338f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:53.575Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/589c3fcb925141250a00338f"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":null},"content":"An enjoyable tale about Rapunzel.\r\n\r\n<em>'Tangled'</em> kicks off Disney's animated releases for the 2010s in very strong fashion. It's nicely created, with fun characters and a hearty storyline. It actually sets a lot of the foundations that 2013's <em>'Frozen'</em> uses, there's a fair amount of similarities between the two.\r\n\r\nMandy Moore does a terrific job in the lead role, she's brings an energetic edge to the character alongside good humour. Zachary Levi (Flynn) and Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel) are more than decent in their respective parts. You also have the amusing (non-speaking) Maximus.\r\n\r\nIt's still very much the usual fairytale/princess thing, but it manages to add a lively turn to proceedings which keeps it entertaining.","created_at":"2020-08-19T17:26:10.324Z","id":"5f3d60b2e295b40033a3a307","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:42.863Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f3d60b2e295b40033a3a307"},{"author":"John","author_details":{"name":"John","username":"johnmills","avatar_path":null,"rating":10.0},"content":"Might be my favorite Disney movie.

This is primarily because Jennifer Lawrence’s character is more mature and she seems more comfortable in the role. She is no longer an immature, naive and lost child. At least not most of the time.\r\n\r\nThe entire setup is still as ludicrous as before. It is a silly and depressing background scenario and it is definitely not my cup of tea. The people running around in ridiculous hair-do, makeup and showing a severe lack of intelligence is not making things better.\r\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this movie comes when the games finally start. These parts are definitely better than in the first movie. The various dangers are well done, the effects good and there is an interesting overall theme to the arena and the dangers instead of randomly throwing new menaces at players that seemed to be the strategy in the first movie.\r\n\r\nTo me the enjoyment of this movie is in the games themselves. This is probably because I just do not like the rest of the plot. The depressing scenario. The nonsensical and/or oppressive behavior, backstabbing etc. etc.","created_at":"2014-09-14T07:22:49.805Z","id":"541542490e0a261c35000ffb","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:28.426Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/541542490e0a261c35000ffb"},{"author":"Andres Gomez","author_details":{"name":"Andres Gomez","username":"tanty","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03a53cd53b8254fe582d4fe1acc26c4e.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"More of the same stuff.\r\n\r\nLawrence is not bad and I think Josh Hutcherson is a great discovering but that's mostly it.","created_at":"2015-02-10T07:25:13.679Z","id":"54d9b259c3a3687ab5000fa3","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:32.146Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/54d9b259c3a3687ab5000fa3"},{"author":"CharlesTheBold","author_details":{"name":"","username":"CharlesTheBold","avatar_path":null,"rating":null},"content":"This is a sequel to 2012's HUNGER GAMES, and is set in the same future world: a post-apocalyptic world where an Empire, called Panem, has imposed peace on the survivors only to decay into brutal tyranny. The symbol of the tyranny is the Hunger Games, a gladiator-type combat where only one \"victor\" is permitted and the rest of the fighters die. To keep the flow of victims coming, 12 districts of Panem are required each year to supply a teenage boy and girl for the fight, ostensibly as punishment for decades-old rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this movie is the moral issues over how to oppose such tyranny. Katniss Everdeen ( Jennifer Lawrence), the spirited girl who won the previous year's Games, wishes to stop the oppression, but fears that outright revolution will hurt too many people. There is another character (whom I won't identify to avoid spoilers) who doesn't care how many people are hurt as long as the revolution is advanced. Many of the subjects of the Empire are resigned to submitting until some messianic deliverer will appear. Meanwhile the ruthless President-for-life Coriolanus Snow ( Donald Sutherland) is determined to destroy the rebels before they can get organized. Who will win out? Therein lies the suspense.\r\n\r\nThere are enough special effects to make the futuristic background and technology credible without overwhelming the movie.\r\nAside from Lawrence and Sutherland as the impressive antagonists, the movie has a strong supporting cast: Woody Harrelson as Katniss's shrewd but alcoholic mentor; Liam Hemworth and Josh Hutcherson as two boys representing the aggressive vs sensitive sides of Katniss's character; Elizabeth Banks as a kindly but naive woman oblivious to the tyranny; Oscar-winner Philip Hoffman as Snow's Machiavellian adviser, and Sam Clafin, Jeffrey Wright, and Jena Malone as formidable former victors drawn into the conflict.\r\nThe movie's only real flaw is that being part of a continuing story keeps the plot from being resolved in the end.","created_at":"2017-02-18T22:23:35.686Z","id":"58a8c9679251410a0e002e67","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:54.533Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58a8c9679251410a0e002e67"},{"author":"Kamurai","author_details":{"name":"Kamurai","username":"Kamurai","avatar_path":"/sKeC7qZLAKreuwxH4x6U3mN7Aa8.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is a great survivalist story in a horrible setting (wonderfully set, written to be a horrible world).\r\n\r\nWe get all the great fun that we got from the original movie, and then we add in the whole (spoiler) element.  It's really what makes the movie and leads us into the next arc, but I won't mention it.\r\n\r\nWith Snow just on an angry tantrum spree (literally using childish tantrum words) you can tell very early that he's defeated himself, it's just a matter of time.\r\n\r\nJennifer Lawrence is a big enough personality to carry the movie and she does with everyone else playing support roles centered around her.  It was fantastic to see Jena Malone come on board as I feel she adds something special to everything she's in.\r\n\r\nIf you can stand the battle royale concept, this this is a good watch for you.","created_at":"2020-08-13T02:00:38.165Z","id":"5f349ec693828e00343c1a87","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:42.572Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f349ec693828e00343c1a87"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Having survived the 74th Hunger Hames, \"Katniss\" (Jennifer Lawrence) and her on-screen beau \"Peeta\" (Josh Hutcherson) now expect to live a life of luxury in their victor's village - but nope, devious president \"Snow\" (Donald Sutherland) has other plans for them. Having dispensed with the services of poor old Wes Bentley, he brings in Philip Seymour Hoffman (\"Plutarch\") to create a sort of Champions League affair with previous - supposedly forever exempt - winners to come back for a \"quell\". It's a good excuse to bring in some old blood two help out the youngsters - Jeffrey Wright (\"Beetee\") probably most notable amongst them, and we pretty much repeat the perilous escapades of the first film. This time, though, the threads of an uprising and a more collaborative approach to resistance start to win through; we see our combatants start to use their heads more, to thwart the divisive aims of their president and the story starts to gain a bit more momentum. Sadly, though - pretty as they are; the acting is still really weak. Lawrence just doesn't engage with me and the new \"Finnick\" (Sam Claflin) character again offers eye candy a-plenty, but squashing a cutie into lycra doesn't make him any better an actor. To be fair, they don't have a great deal by way of decent dialogue to deliver as almost all of this is an exercise of advanced CGI. The ending does, at least, offer us promise that the third leg of this franchise will offer more scope to vary the theme a bit, but as far as this is concerned, it's nothing at all special.","created_at":"2022-04-27T09:06:39.328Z","id":"6269079f64f716160d0ea5ff","updated_at":"2022-04-27T09:06:39.328Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6269079f64f716160d0ea5ff"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":7}},{"id":1398133,"title":"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire","original_title":"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire","plot_overview":"Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark.

Certainly the plot is pretty far-fetched, but once the film gets up a head of steam, it is quickly paced with some well placed jump scenes that work quite well. Stephen Lang is effective as the blind fella, trying to rescue his \"daughter\" from her long-lost family, and is especially so once we find out just quite why they are so keen on re-uniting. Madelyn Grace is also quite competent as the young girl \"Phoenix\" and I found Fiona O'Shaughnessy's particularly odious \"mother\" character quite detestable too.

There might be weird critics with this movie but for me, I liked it. The action scenes were just right. It wasn't too much and it wasn't too little. It was weird seeing Don Cheadle though play Terrence Howard's character. I like Terrence better. And then there's Scarlett Johansson who is really sexy although I think there weren't that many acting for her in this movie. There weren't many lines. And what was weird also was that in this movie, the chemistry between Tony Stark and Pepper was not that much compared to the first movie although in this movie they actually ended up together.

Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it's about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it's this pretty okay action film that's worth taking a look at. Then, there's this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn't really a genre, it's just about the characters interacting with each other, it's about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets _Iron Man 2_ apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.\r\n\r\nWhen films go franchise-style, it's inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it's an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in _Iron Man 2_ when Lt. Col. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character's first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are \"Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it. Let's move on. Drop it.\" Very classy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mickey Rourke (_Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables_) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who's a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (_The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost/Nixon, Moon, Conviction_) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark's. Scarlett Johansen (_Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit_) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (_Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds_) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it's all good news.\r\n\r\nThe Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn't really work out. Once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, 'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; \"Congratulations sir, you have created a new element\", is a little flawed.\r\n\r\nThough if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that _Iron Man_ is the better of the two films, but _Iron Man 2_ has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly. I wait with baited breath for the next Marvel film to come out, _Thor_.\r\n\r\n63%\r\n\r\n-Gimly","created_at":"2018-06-04T11:26:30.345Z","id":"5b1521e60e0a262ddc008184","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:09.264Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b1521e60e0a262ddc008184"},{"author":"tmdb44006625","author_details":{"name":"","username":"tmdb44006625","avatar_path":null,"rating":3.0},"content":"Honestly, it took me three tries to get through this movie once.

Furthermore, the main character, Tony Stark, is perhaps one of the nastiest and most irritating comic heroes, and this movie seems to try to accentuate that by turning the protagonist into a spoiled playboy who has expensive toys and looks at women like if they were, also, toys. Okay, I know the character was also portrayed like that in the original books, even though I'm not a comics fan. But the movie could give something that made Tony Stark someone we could really care about.\r\n\r\nIn this film, the hero will face his first great antagonist, the son of a Soviet scientist that Stark's father knew. At the same time, Stark has to face the US Army, who are eager to get their hands on the combat suits he created, discovering that his father knew of a new chemical element, not yet officially discovered, and in which lies the key for the survival of Stark himself. With these brief lines, we can see, right away, that the script is not exactly one of the strong points of the film. The feeling that remains is that the script shoots in several directions, trying to create a more complex story, but that something got in the way and prevented that objective.\r\n\r\nThe cast basically has the same names as the previous film. Robert Downey Jr. is back to the red armor for yet another film, where he has shown himself to be deftly sarcastic and irritating without losing his heroic pose. Mickey Rourke is a welcome addition to the cast, playing the villain. The actor was able to adapt to the character quite competently. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also return, but they don't do more than they did in the previous film, still fulfilling what was asked of them. Scarlett Johansson deserves a praise for her work here, but the rest of the cast just do what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nThe film is yet another very expensive blockbuster, abundantly financed by Marvel, and it is very obvious that it will become one of the most watched films of the season. With so much money and financial interest involved, the film was doomed to a loud and flashy bet on high-quality, but still obviously false, effects and CGI. The film has a lot of action and the fights are excellent, although obviously choreographed and stilted. The cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and magnificently beautiful. The film bets a lot on quality props, good sets and costumes, as well as a good soundtrack.","created_at":"2022-07-16T04:50:38.667Z","id":"62d2439e5f4b7300560d0724","updated_at":"2022-07-16T04:50:38.667Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62d2439e5f4b7300560d0724"},{"author":"doubleyoudot","author_details":{"name":"","username":"doubleyoudot","avatar_path":null,"rating":5.0},"content":"Watched in chronological order 2022.\r\n\r\nGenius bachelor who's also an idiot makes more advanced toys and fights his company betraying him.

Daniel doesn't have fun. He writes pages waxing lyrical on a film like 'Roma' that starts with a five-minute sequence of someone cleaning up dog poo, or 'A Hidden Life' that's 60% glorious shots of landscapes. But hey! I can have fun! I loved 'The Meg'! I lost my mind in the first Transformers film! When The Rock rode up a tsunami, avoiding an oil tanker that then took out the Golden Gate Bridge in 'San Andreas', I was on my feet in the cinema cheering! This film though? This isn't fun. It's too loud, too hard to follow, too bonkers to be appealing, and not anywhere near bonkers enough to be charming or good for a laugh. It's a film that basically yells at you for an hour and a half in the most aggressive, hyper-masculine way, and leaves you feeling like you've been stuck in a corner at a party for three hours having some guy tell you all about the screenplay he's going to write that will finally, finally be a good video game adaptation and never taking the hint you want a drink or a pee or a change in conversation or to run screaming from the room. I went into Paul W. S. Anderson's latest film (the guy who made 'Mortal Combat' and 'Death Race', not 'Boogie Nights' and 'Punch-Drunk Love') totally prepared to have a blast, but it gave me no time, space or inclination to do so. And then this stupid film that doesn't know whether it wants to be a bad 'Godzilla' or a shitty reimagining of 'The Dark Tower' has the audacity to set itself up for a sequel! (But hey, we're in the End Times, so it only makes sense that we would get a sequel to this trash instead of another season of 'Mindhunter'). I'm sure some people are going to get a kick out of this saga about Artemis (Hunter, of Monsters, titular) fighting big asshole spiders and being the saviour white woman to a far more impressive person of colour and crying over some ring (it was for “forever“, remember). For me? The whole thing is too loud and aggressive and dull to be the best kind of dumb fun.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-monster-hunter-a-meandering-mundane-monstrosity","created_at":"2020-12-30T06:35:34.591Z","id":"5fec1fb61d1bf4003f13a633","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:49.428Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5fec1fb61d1bf4003f13a633"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"It appears that this movie is either quite hated or quite liked. I guess it is not that surprising though given that it is based on a video game with a very strong following so if the movie is deviating from canon, and I understand that it does, it will not matter how good or bad a movie is.\r\n\r\nWell, I have never played the game so I am not burdened with Monster Hunter canon so I have to say that I very much liked this movie. It does not really hurt that I quite like Milla Jovovich as well of course. Ron Perlman is also a favourite of mine and I really wish that he would have been in more of the movie. As it was he was only present briefly at the beginning and then a little bit at the end.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a fantasy, action movie of my liking. Clash of cultures, huge monsters and lots and lots of shooting, slicing, kicking and stabbing action. The story is rather simple but not really bad at all. The ships navigating the sand was a bit weird and those huge weapons they were dragging around a bit silly but then those are part of the canon.\r\n\r\nAt first I got a bit annoyed by Artemis and Hunter starting to fight each other and thought, oh no, not another one of those silly, illogical stories again, but that sorted itself out rather quickly. And the bait jokes were rather funny actually.\r\n\r\nThe CGI and the monsters were great, as far as I am concerned. When I first saw the diablos I thought that they had kind of copied the sandworms from Dune but when they, or it rather since we only got to see one actually emerge, it was quite different.\r\n\r\nThe part where Artemis is thrown back to Earth and followed by the big fire breathing beastie is probably not liked at all by the fans of the video games since it is probably not very canon but I definitely liked it. I whish they would have done a bit more surprise, what the f… and mayhem scenes there actually.\r\n\r\nThe ending didn’t really leave that much of a conclusion but, unlike what some people seems to feel, I didn’t think it was a bad ending. It certainly prepared the field for a sequel and I for one really hope one will come.","created_at":"2021-05-02T20:41:45.134Z","id":"608f0e892b531d006e35c5a9","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:55.125Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/608f0e892b531d006e35c5a9"},{"author":"Kamurai","author_details":{"name":"Kamurai","username":"Kamurai","avatar_path":"/sKeC7qZLAKreuwxH4x6U3mN7Aa8.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI'm not a real fan of the video game, so I think I can safely say that you don't need to know anything from the game other than it has \"big monsters\".\r\n\r\nThe only thing I really see from the video game world is that the characters sort of \"level up\" as the movie progresses.  I guess it sort of does world building in the same way by having \"levels\" or areas, but that's much more subtle.\r\n\r\nThe movie uses isolation in several different ways and has some clever uses of limited resources to solve problems, but it is quite a bit of just fighting big monsters.\r\n\r\nI can't say that you'll enjoy this if you're into Kaiju movies, even though it has quite a bit of creature feature aspects to it.\r\n\r\nWorth the watch, but not exactly the most substantial story.","created_at":"2021-06-19T22:12:24.188Z","id":"60ce6bc8967cc7005841f0d4","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:57.056Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60ce6bc8967cc7005841f0d4"},{"author":"DallasBob","author_details":{"name":"","username":"DallasBob","avatar_path":"/q0CeevK9dSVKgU8LIns3qttIBq1.jpg","rating":null},"content":"Okay, what to say?  It's not the worst I've seen, and I think it could have been better.  The Resident Evil chick is a consistantly above average action star.  I put her up  there as a female Bruce Willis or Jason Statham.  And she delivered in this movie the same pazazz as her other action flicks.  \r\nThe Story, like the budget, was not that deep.  And if there was significant money put into this movie, then I don't think it measured up to expectations; producer nor fan.  Again, the movie was not terrible, but I didn't exactly move to the edge of my seat either.  \r\nThe fight between her and her soon to be friend, was a bit...contrived.  To me, it was his world, she wasn't an elite soldier, and he was an experienced hunter, so while their fight was well coordinated, I had an especially difficult time believing she could keep up with the  hunter in a fight; had to mark it up as movie-magic or \"it's in the script.\"  \r\nSpecial effects were good for what they were and the actors did a good job of acting.  I don't think the star spent enough time interacting with the Monster Hunter world.  I get they were out in the middle of nowhere, but having her go through a city or market to find a 'macguffin' to help with getting her home, might have added a bit more submersion for the audience.  But just putting her in a set of Monster Hunter armor and spending 5 minutes on their sand-ship felt like what it was, cheap or 'shot-on-a-budget.'  \r\nThe ending was okay too.  I like how the dragon took out the modern aircraft, and was impressed how they were able to shoot everything in the daytime and still make it look feasible to the action. If there is a sequel, then I hope they get a bit more Conan-ny with the overall feel; i.e., more Monster Hunter world & residents. (no pun intended)\r\n\r\nThe movie is not terrible, but I won't be rushing out to get a copy, nor looking for it online.  It's entertaining for a Netchix n' Chill night.","created_at":"2022-04-19T05:32:51.734Z","id":"625e4983f10a1a31c1f570c8","updated_at":"2022-04-19T05:36:35.020Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/625e4983f10a1a31c1f570c8"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4}},{"id":1534422,"title":"Monster Hunter","original_title":"Monster Hunter","plot_overview":"A portal transports Cpt.

being delayed multiple times from a planned November 2019 release; Writer/Director Matthew Vaughn has released the third film in the “Kingsman “film series with “The King’s Man”. This time around the movie looks back to the origins of the society dedicated to peace and solving global conflicts before they can escalate.\r\n\r\nIn pre-World War I Europe; wealthy pacifist Orlando Oxford (Ralph Finnes); looks to raise his son Conrad (Harris Dickinson); following the tragic loss of his wife some years earlier on a Red Cross mission.\r\n\r\nWhen events kick off the war; Conrad wishes to enlist and fight and his father is able to keep this from happening as he wants his son to avoid the horrors of war. At the same time; a secret Cabal has been plotting to start the war and manipulate the outcome and one of the agents named Rasputin (Rhys Ifans); looms prominently due to his influence over the Czar of Russia.\r\n\r\nAs the years pass and the war unfolds; Conrad and Orlando soon find themselves at odds and being pulled into opposite directions which sets a chain of events into action and puts the fate of the world in the balance.\r\n\r\nThe film is at times more retrained than the prior two films but the action sequences when they arrive are entertaining and mix the humor and violence that the series is known for. The cast is solid and the way that historical events were used but given an alternate perspective really added to the enjoyment of the film.\r\n\r\nThe movie does have a decent amount of humor but does spend a great deal of time on character development and exposition which can lead to some long gaps between the action, but the engaging stories and characters hold your interest throughout.\r\n\r\nThe film sets up further adventures in the Prequel timeline well and it appears that this is the direction that future films may go which would be more than fine as the film delivered what fans have come to expect from the series.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-12-14T18:56:27.237Z","id":"61b8e8db7d5f4b0042922b41","updated_at":"2021-12-14T18:56:27.237Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61b8e8db7d5f4b0042922b41"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"This movie ended up being quite unique and not in a good way. The uniqueness comes from the fact that I actually agree with the critics rating at that abysmally woke, leftist and useless site Rotten Tomatoes that this movie is not very good. That I agree with that rubbish site is rare indeed.\r\n\r\nAs a standalone movie I probably would have rated it higher but as a movie in the Kingsman franchise I have to say that it was a disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe movie sets a quite different tone than the other Kingsman movies. This movie is quite gloomy. The story, which takes the history of the first world war and the Russian revolution and rewrites everything behind those events, is pretty ridiculous. The stories in the two previous Kingsman movies was no masterpieces but this historical rewrite is just wrong. Especially when playing with historical events that has caused more suffering than more or less anything else in modern history.\r\n\r\nThe coolness of the two previous movies is more or less gone. I cannot figure out if this movie tried to be serious or humorous but it fails on both accounts.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Oxford’s overprotection of his son and his pacifism during most of the movie was just tiresome. What eventually happened to his son was rather predictable but the way they did it was like they where just trying to piss the audience off. Incredibly frustrating.\r\n\r\nThen we have Rasputin. The entire Rasputin part was mostly alternating between silly and disgusting.\r\n\r\nThe Duke’s maid/nurse was a nice part though although the actor was not really very good in the role. Also, I am not sure that this “network of domestic servants” felt very plausible.\r\n\r\nThere were some outbursts of action that was not too bad. Especially towards the end when the Duke finally seemed to get his act together and drop this pacifist rubbish. I do however exclude most the world war scenes from the good action. They were just gloomy, sad and, at times, unrealistic and silly.\r\n\r\nOverall this movie was just so unlike the other two movies, and not in a good way, that I really did not like it. It was not really fun to watch. As I wrote it was gloomy most of the time. As it used the events leading to world war one and the Russian revolution it was just one disastrous setback after each other. The only positive event in the movie was really at the end when the Duke of Oxford, founded the Kingsman agency.\r\n\r\nReading the synopsis one might get the idea about the Kingsman agency being created and I hoped more of the movie would have been about the actual creation but the movie is really two hours of long winded often gloomy, sometimes silly, drama and then there are less than two minutes where the Duke of Oxford proclaims the agency created. Not what I expected to be honest.","created_at":"2022-06-27T15:44:35.197Z","id":"62b9d0633d43e013f84a579f","updated_at":"2022-06-27T15:44:35.197Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62b9d0633d43e013f84a579f"},{"author":"JPRetana","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPRetana","avatar_path":"/eYudFTVvIpCweDVQEl878whalTy.jpg","rating":1.0},"content":"The King’s Man is a mostly harmless movie, unless you, like Rasputin, “consider being boring offensive”; if that’s the case, then you’re most likely going to want to demand satisfaction from co-writer/director Matthew Vaughn. This is an exceedingly long movie, yet it somehow can’t or won’t find the time or space to fit in a little logic.\r\n\r\nConsider the following. A group of British citizens go to Moscow to kill Rasputin, whom they believe to be a pernicious influence on the Tsar – and that he is, but that doesn’t change the fact that Rasputin remains the Tsar’s closest and most trusted advisor. One would not expect the Russian monarch to be too keen on continuing his alliance with England if he knew a bunch of English covert agents just assassinated, with extreme prejudice, his right hand man. Fortunately he never finds out – or at least doesn’t appear to do so; the scene where the British cover up the murder and make it look like an accident or whatever has gone missing, presumably because it was never written, let alone shot.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I rather liked Rasputin’s death scene, which recreates all manners of his fabled death (or, to be more specific, the myth surrounding it created by Prince Felix Yusupov); poison, beating, bullet wounds, and drowning in freezing water. This, by the way, is not a spoiler; first because it happens halfway through the movie (and in this case “halfway” means there’s still a very long way to go), and second because his legendary demise is so well known it even has a trope named after it.\r\n\r\nYou know what else would not be a spoiler? The identity of the criminal mastermind behind the nameless organization – I would suggest OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym), were it not already taken – intent on wreaking havoc upon the world; identity which I will not reveal because it should be readily apparent to anyone familiar with the Law of Economy of Characters (in which a seemingly minor or unimportant character turns out to be much more crucial to the plot than they first appear to be). I will only add that the villain’s uncanny ability to impossibly go from point A to a point beyond the alphabet, aided by little more than the requirements of the script, produces a plot hole so big a submarine could pass through it – and literally does.","created_at":"2022-08-28T05:43:33.254Z","id":"630b00855907de007dace4f1","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:32:14.213Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630b00855907de007dace4f1"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1500837,"title":"The

This could have worked if it had explored a new story in the 'Toy Story' universe, and Forky certainly makes it clear that such a move could have worked beautifully. Instead, we have a film that feels tired and forced, lacking in clarity or inspiration, serving neither its classic characters or its new ones, and ultimately never justifying its existence.

Tim Allen is solid as Buzz Lightyear, but I kinda feel they don't use him - or the other originals - enough considering who they are. It is, though, cool to see an old face return in Bo Peep (Annie Potts).\r\n\r\nThere are some more new characters and yet again, like in the past films, they strike the right chords. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are, entirely unsurprisingly, funny in the roles of Ducky & Bunny. Christina Hendricks is a good Gabby, while Keanu Reeves amuses as Duke Caboom.\r\n\r\nThe film focuses on giving the viewer(s) extremely heartfelt moments and for the vast majority it hits as intended, though they do try to tug on the heart too much in parts. The animation is stunning, especially in the early scene with RC.\r\n\r\nIs it a thing everyone wanted? Most probably not. Yet is there fun to be had? Most definitely. For a third sequel, you gotta give respect to Pixar & Co.","created_at":"2020-06-29T19:17:41.634Z","id":"5efa3e55db952d0036158cfc","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:39.937Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5efa3e55db952d0036158cfc"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"I remember my dad telling me that when I was much younger, I was given a big toy tractor for Christmas, and spent the whole day playing in it's box! This time, it's \"Bonnie\" who shuns her established toys so she can play with \"Forky\" - a plastic canteen fork with a few hastily improvised appendages. \"Forky\" has a few self esteem issues, but luckily, the long-suffering \"Woody\" and the rest of the gang are on hand to help walk him through his new life. The plot centres around an escaped-laden road trip with \"Woody\" hooking up, again, with \"Bo-Peep\" and having a bit of a reminisce. There are plenty of fun adventures, the new characters - especially \"Key\" and \"Peele\" - who have a lovely, slick, comedy timing add an extra layer of enjoyment, and there is a script that still delivers plenty of humour and a just a little food for thought. The characterisations retain their traits of loyalty, silliness and mischievousness as we head to what I can only assume is closure for the series. Their future is presented with a tinge of sadness, but also with a considerable degree of optimism as the toys demonstrate that they, too, have grown up over the years. It's a fitting conclusion to this franchise that retains the generous spirit of the preceding three and ends on an high note.","created_at":"2022-07-01T06:34:38.985Z","id":"62be957efba62500e9a5503e","updated_at":"2022-07-01T06:34:38.985Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62be957efba62500e9a5503e"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":5}},{"id":1438469,"title":"Toy Story 4","original_title":"Toy Story 4","plot_overview":"Woody has always been confident about his place in the world and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that's Andy or Bonnie.
