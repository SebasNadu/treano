The score and sound effects make every moment uneasy and uncomfortable, and not in a good way. Smile’s premise bore many similarities to It Follows with much poorer execution. Smile stumbled from jump scare to jump scare. I started closing my eyes because the jump scares were so predictable, and I was tired of having disturbing images screamed in my face. I will say that Sosie Bacon did an excellent job with what she was given, with her performance being the only bright spot in the film. Unfortunately, the movie was unimpressive and tried to cloak mediocrity in a fountain of jump scares, stressful noises, and unpleasant moments.","created_at":"2022-09-29T04:05:24.726Z","id":"63351984c2679600847bb34a","updated_at":"2022-09-29T04:05:24.824Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63351984c2679600847bb34a"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"As an avid horror fan, I can genuinely say that Smile unsettled me beyond belief. In many horror films of today, directors rely solely on jump scares to create this sense of shock and horror. But in Smile, Parker Finn is able to build suspense and tension throughout a scene to then crescendo into a jump scare that the audience knows is coming but are so tense that they cannot help but to release into fright.\r\n\r\nWhile this movie does not break major ground in terms of plot and storytelling there is some depth that is added with mental health and the feeling of isolation during manic episodes. I felt for Rose throughout this entire film, as she used to be the one helping patients through mental crisis and now that she is having one of her own, she is met with the same doubts even though it is a genuine fear. The sense of hopelessness grows throughout the movie as hope drains from our lead actress.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of our lead actress, Sosie Bacon is fantastic in this movie. She carries every single scene she is in, which is just about every one. Her minor facial movements and eye expressions were so sad and realistic to that of someone experiencing trauma. I loved everything about her performance and will be excited to see her moving forward. The other performances were average across the board, but they didn't really have a lot to work with and filled their roles well. Jessie Usher felt a little out of place though, I feel like he did the nice and charismatic husband role well but when he had to display genuine fear and anger he overacted quite a bit.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wanted to touch on the ending. I am not going to spoil anything for the audience, but this is exactly what I wanted throughout the entire film. I kept asking myself, are they going to do it? But second guessed myself and when the payoff happened, I left the theater with a big Smile on my face.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _75%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_","created_at":"2022-10-14T18:06:31.034Z","id":"6349a527e263bb0084f27628","updated_at":"2022-10-14T18:06:31.109Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6349a527e263bb0084f27628"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"\"Dr. Rose Cotter\" (Sosie Bacon) is a dedicated clinical psychologist who witnesses the gruesome suicide of a young woman in her hospital consulting room. Traumatised, as you might expect, she gradually starts to suffer from unexpected goings on in her own life. Her relationship becomes unstable and soon she appears to have but a tenuous grasp on reality herself. What's going on? Is she doomed to a similar fate? This has something of the \"Azazel\" theory to it, and as the story develops director Parker Finn manages to build quite a degree of mystery and suspense. The malevolence of her haunting spirit is well captured by those working the audio - the sound effects and the score contribute well to the overall feel of this film. The acting though, well I am sorry - I found that to be a terrible let down. Initially, Bacon owned the film but after a few moments she just hadn't the weight to carry the thing in what is, essentially, a one-hander. Her support comes mainly for her ex-boyfriend/cop and all round sceptic about the whole thing \"Joel\" (Kyle Gallner) after her boyfriend \"Trevor\" (Jessie T. Usher) and her own erstwhile psychiatrist played by an indifferent Robin Weigert give up the ghost with her. Sadly, they offer little to add depth to this rather superficial horror effort. There are jump moments, but they lose their potency as this actor fails to capitalise on the tensions being created around her. Perhaps had the story spent less time on her character development, and the pace been tightened up a bit then we might have had less time to worry about that; but the style of the photography with too many lingering images merely serves to sterilise the whole thing for me. I was really disappointed, and after a while just wanted to go watch \"Fallen\" (1998) instead.","created_at":"2022-10-21T08:53:57.843Z","id":"63525e254ca676007a52b46e","updated_at":"2022-10-21T08:53:57.939Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63525e254ca676007a52b46e"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"MORE SPOILER-FREE MINI-REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/mini-reviews-2022-edition\r\n\r\n\"Smile deserves the praise it has received since its release.\r\n\r\nParker Finn's feature directorial debut contains haunting levels of suspense, consequently creating surprisingly effective jumpscare sequences.

The film's story was worth telling; it left an impression long after the credits rolled. It dealt with many weighty themes, including a young man's journey through war, the difficulties of combat, the cruelty of desperation, and the value of friendship and camaraderie, all of which were handled with grace and artistry. Furthermore, it boasted first-rate production values, breathtaking visuals, a terrific score (although maybe a tad bit over the top), and stellar acting. Although there is much to praise about the film, “All Quiet on the Western Front” is ultimately hampered by its drawn-out length, the plot dragging in spots, and several confusing moments. All the pieces were in place for “All Quiet on the Western Front” to be the best picture of the year, and in some respects, it is. Fans of the genre, or anyone who appreciates a well-made film, should not miss this film despite its limitations.\r\n___\r\nRating: ***7.5/10*** *(Impressive, yet it doesn't quite hit the mark in every respect)*","created_at":"2022-11-02T03:47:40.336Z","id":"6361e85c5900861109817e1c","updated_at":"2022-11-02T03:47:40.451Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6361e85c5900861109817e1c"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Making of All Quiet on the Western Front [Subtitled]","key":"3qP0Z04UrJY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":true,"published_at":"2022-11-16T18:00:00.000Z","id":"6375778011c06600abe24105"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"hf8EYbVxtCY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-10-20T13:00:00.000Z","id":"635183a4f3b49a007dd2e426"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Teaser","key":"qFqgmaO15x4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-09-06T12:00:00.000Z","id":"631741b0028420008077debc"}]}},{"id":1521342,"title":"All Quiet on the Western Front","original_title":"Im Westen nichts Neues","plot_overview":"Paul Baumer and his friends Albert and Muller, egged on by romantic dreams of heroism, voluntarily enlist in the German army.

is a gory movie with a sadistic killer clown that revels in mutilating his victims in creative ways and willing to use any kind of improvised weapon as well as one not often seen in slasher movies. The movie makes effective use of practical effects and the gory murders are graphic enough to make you know this movie means business. David Howard Thornton stars as Art the Clown and his portrayal is devilishly effective as a villain who is mute and must use facial gestures to express himself in his ghoulish clown makeup. The story is the usual cat and mouse variety but this film is more about watching Art capture, torture and mutilate his victims. Terrifier is an effective and bloody slasher film that follows the usual formula of 1980's horror films and has crowned Art the Clown as one of the new faces of horror.","created_at":"2019-07-21T22:02:10.366Z","id":"5d34e0e22f8d090388d4540e","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:24.724Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d34e0e22f8d090388d4540e"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":3.0},"content":"_Terrifier_ had a lot of hype behind it with its very successful sequel hitting theaters this month, and unfortunately it did not translate to a pleasurable viewing experience. Before I jump into my criticisms of the film, the on-screen quality of visuals and effects were top notch for a budget of a mere $25,000. It is amazing what this crew was able to do with their conditions and everyone involved should be proud. With that being said, the limited budget does not give excuses for a poor script, dialogue and performances. This movie had a tremendous amount of cringe with perverted dialogue that seemed as if a middle schooler wrote it. The performances were campy, but not in a good way. In classic horror films the camp has a sense of nostalgia and a sign of the times but with this modern film with kills and elements that are taking themselves somewhat seriously, it just comes off as bad. The actor behind Art did do a fantastic job though. His portrayal of a mute killer who communicates to his victims with mimes and clown tricks was funny and chilling at the same time. The plot on its face did not have much depth to it. It boiled down to people in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was no added depth or lore to why these events were happening, although I did enjoy how each character who was tragically murdered had a connection the plot and were not just some random people introduced and killed in a single scene just to pad the kill count. As horror film, this movie failed to add any stakes or tension. The director leaned more into the gore which can be unsettling to look at but never made me feel uneasy. There was no build up to any of the kills, these classic horror elements made the movie seem extremely bland. Overall, I think this film is a marvel from a technical perspective based on its low budget, but when judging it from a film perspective it left me bored and waiting for the credits.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _33%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Bad_","created_at":"2022-10-17T20:22:30.837Z","id":"634db9861089ba0082f09165","updated_at":"2022-10-17T20:22:30.923Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/634db9861089ba0082f09165"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1374263,"title":"Terrifier","original_title":"Terrifier","plot_overview":"On

Rather gorily, she engineers a daring escape and somehow manages to get to the United States where she convinces \"Allen\" (Rossif Sutherland) that she is his long lost daughter. Well whilst dad might be fooled, the wife \"Tricia\" (Julia Stiles) and her son \"Gunnar\" (Matthew Finlan) soon catch on - but it seems that they have secrets of their own to keep. Can an uneasy truce prevail between them? Well, no - of course not but frankly I really couldn't have cared less. She is all too readily accepted into the wealthy American family (no DNA tests with her father to verify?) and as the story plods along, it loses any grasp on plausibility. We are required to believe that \"Esther\" is this epitome of evil, but the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese so I kept asking myself just how any of this could ever actually happen - even in cinema land. It does have the benefit of being quite short, and to be fair to director William Brent Bell, he doesn't hang around once what passes for the story gets going. I just found the whole thing too nonsensical and the lead character had more of a petulance to her than any believable sense of menace.","created_at":"2022-08-29T13:51:56.010Z","id":"630cc47bb3e627007d45c05b","updated_at":"2022-08-29T13:54:55.931Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630cc47bb3e627007d45c05b"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1620743,"title":"Orphan: First Kill","original_title":"Orphan: First Kill","plot_overview":"After escaping from an Estonian psychiatric facility, Leena Klammer travels to America by impersonating Esther, the missing daughter of a wealthy family.

pace can sometimes feel haphazard or arbitrary, but the strong finale makes it all worthwhile.**\r\n\r\nThe Watcher builds slowly, spending plenty of time emphasizing the main character's isolation and loneliness. Each passing moment of this slow burn accentuates the paranoia of being watched. Maika Monroe proves her horror chops once again with Watcher, as she has before with movies like It Follows and The Guest. I wanted to give this movie a better rating than 3/5 but the gradual crawling pace of the film, although intentional and effective in creating tension, had me looking at my phone out of bordem. The last 20 minutes of the movie are intense and pay off nicely, though, and make it worth hanging around until the end.

While this movie does attempt to deliver on that premise, it does so in a way that is incredibly long and dragged out. By the time the movie really had me hooked, it would cut away to a different scene and completely ruin any resemblance of momentum it had going for it. This results in a very uneven viewing experience that left me bored more often than not. The performance by Maika Monroe was brilliant and she does such an excellent job of portraying loneliness throughout the film. Even though she was surrounded by her husband and friends the sense of isolation this movie and Monroe builds is entrapping. The audience can genuinely empathies with her, creating a wonderful protagonist to root for. Despite the uneven story and the slowness of the entire film, the ending did leave me incredibly satisfied. This film is one that I appreciated the premise and the attempted delivery over enjoying the film as an experience, which tacks on an additional half a star to my rating.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _69%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_","created_at":"2022-10-25T15:28:49.264Z","id":"635800b143250f007d05c193","updated_at":"2022-10-25T15:28:49.335Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/635800b143250f007d05c193"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"\"Julia\" (Maika Monroe) and her husband \"Francis\" (Karl Glusman) relocate from New York to his native Romania so he can take up a job in Bucharest. She has not a word of the native language, and so is pretty much on the back foot from the start as he goes to work each day leaving her to fend for herself. It's when she is looking out of their window one evening that she thinks she spots someone staring back at her. She waves, it waves back... What's going on? Is it just a bored next door neighbour or is something more dastardly afoot? Things become more sister for her when, returning home one night with her husband, she learns of the gruesome murder of a young woman nearby. Chloe Okuno does a decent job at creating and sustaining a certain sense of menace here. It's added by a decent script and a solid effort from Monroe as the increasingly paranoid woman who may be in great danger, or who may just have a very vivid imagination! I wasn't mad on the ending - it very nearly worked but I felt it hadn't quite the courage of what would have been a far more fitting conviction. It's not a great film, no - but it uses our imagination to do much of the work here and at times is really quite effective and certainly it is a bit different from a psychological perspective.","created_at":"2022-11-09T15:07:51.155Z","id":"636bc24721621b0091111511","updated_at":"2022-11-09T15:07:51.249Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/636bc24721621b0091111511"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1630808,"title":"Watcher","original_title":"Watcher","plot_overview":"As

This time around it is 16th birthday girl \"Becca\" (Whitney Peak) and her best friend \"Izzy\" (Belinda Escobedo) who inadvertently disturb the witches using a magic candle. Needless to say, our tricky trio are ravenous for children to eat and are seeking a little bit of revenge too! It takes a bit too long for the the Divine Miss M and company to take to the screen, before that this is a rather muddled teenage affair, but once they are in full swing it is quite good fun with plenty of faux malevolence from \"Winifred\" and some mischief from her sisters once they discover that they, too, can zap folks. Ultimately, even the book of spells gets to choose it's own destiny - but whom will it follow? Star of the film is definitely \"Billy Butcherson\" - or his disembodied head, and a lively reversion of Blondie's \"One Way or Another\" gets the toes tapping away nicely too. This is an enjoyable family film that does what it sets out to do - entertain all in a gently, engaging and entirely forgettable fashion.","created_at":"2022-11-10T16:35:03.946Z","id":"636d28371684f700c4e9fb7b","updated_at":"2022-11-10T16:35:04.031Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/636d28371684f700c4e9fb7b"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1617992,"title":"Hocus Pocus 2","original_title":"Hocus Pocus 2","plot_overview":"29 years since the Black Flame Candle was last lit, the 17th-century Sanderson sisters are resurrected, and they are looking for revenge.

SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/pinocchio-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Pinocchio boasts a more thematically impactful ending than the original but fails to deliver a new version of the famous childhood tale with the same magic and allure of the past.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks and most of the voice cast embody the spirit of the 1940's flick perfectly, but the characters lack further development and imaginative modifications. The blend between animation and CGI components with real humans and sets is awkwardly inconsistent, leaving the viewers with a weird sensation throughout the whole runtime.\r\n\r\nThe cast's musical prowess and memorable songs help with the entertainment aspect, but overall, it's a somewhat disappointing new take.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C","created_at":"2022-09-08T09:34:44.814Z","id":"6319b734002134007f8e10b9","updated_at":"2022-09-08T09:34:44.900Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6319b734002134007f8e10b9"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":3.0},"content":"_Pinocchio_ has been begrudgingly transformed from a flawed animated masterpiece into this shiny, superfluous turd of a live-action film. The majority of the classic characters have been mangled in some capacity while new characters are lame fluff serving as more of insurmountable obstacles you’re forced to endure rather than offering any sort of entertainment value or overall purpose to the actual story. With tangled strings and meandering storytelling, _Pinocchio_ is a musical misfire that attempts to annihilate everything that made its animated counterpart so enjoyable. \r\n\r\n**Full review:**

The clean editing helps with the few yet violent fight sequences in a film driven by the two protagonists and their respective arcs.\r\n\r\nThe third act risks it all by \"toying\" with the audience's intellect, but it's still a decent watch.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-","created_at":"2022-09-27T21:23:10.059Z","id":"633369be41eee10086e6bdc9","updated_at":"2022-09-27T21:23:10.160Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/633369be41eee10086e6bdc9"},{"author":"Peter McGinn","author_details":{"name":"Peter McGinn","username":"narrator56","avatar_path":"/tVbrLJzA2RwRlE7dJLJG54UsAkq.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"I don’t watch thrillers as a rule, so I will not try to compare it to others in that genre. I gave this a try only because of Allison Janney, who first impressed me in West Wing and later in Mom. Of course, this is a different breed of character for her altogether.\r\n\r\nIn a few ways the movie stuck close to the formula of the restrictive thriller genre: the supervillain who is always one step ahead until near the end, the fight scenes where any one blow would knock out a real person, scenes from the past filling in where character development leaves off, and plot twists I could see coming yards away. But the movie had a couple of surprises for me, the body count wasn’t as high as usual, and Janney put in her usual strong performance, so I stayed with it until the end, as did my wife, who enjoys thrillers even less than I do. So I guess that speaks volumes for Lou in the end.","created_at":"2022-10-28T10:40:10.073Z","id":"635bb18a1b72940083124d13","updated_at":"2022-10-28T10:40:10.171Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/635bb18a1b72940083124d13"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}},{"id":1532084,"title":"Lou","original_title":"Lou","plot_overview":"A young girl is kidnapped during a powerful storm.

His mission soon puts him on a collision course with Gorr and The Mighty Thor (Natalie Portman) who being his ex and wielding his former weapon causes more than a few funny and awkward moments.\r\n\r\nIn a race to save captured children, rally the gods, and defeat Gorr, Thor, and Jane along with Korr (Taika Waititi) and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), embark on an epic adventure in a race against time.\r\n\r\nWhile audiences have come to expect Marvel films to be epic cinematic events, this film is less on the over-the-top action sequences in favor of establishing new circumstances and challenges for the characters going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile there are indeed action sequences and plenty of VFX, it does not have the action or intensity of several of the past films. What it does offer is a good mix of action and humor with enjoyable characters old and new and establishes scenarios for the MCU going forward.\r\n\r\nBale is very good as Gorr and you understand his motivations clearly as while evil, he has a degree of sympathy towards his character which makes his creepy performance all the more compelling.\r\n\r\nThe cast works very well with one another and there are two scenes in the credits which open up all kinds of possibilities for the future as we are told Thor will return before the credits even begin to roll.\r\n\r\nThe film also has considerable music and I joked to myself that Guns and Roses are going to be getting a big check due to their music being used frequently during the film as well as that of other artists which helps make the film an enjoyable outing from start to finish which should delight fans as we wait to see for the next cinematic offering from Marvel.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2022-07-05T13:08:30.584Z","id":"62c437ce22e48038847e2b0c","updated_at":"2022-07-05T13:08:30.584Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62c437ce22e48038847e2b0c"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/thor-love-and-thunder-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Thor: Love and Thunder boasts a bittersweet story about finding peace and love in suffering and pain, without forgetting the necessary thunderous action that reaches its best level in a long sequence surrounded by a breathtaking black-and-white color palette.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale stands out with a terrifying performance as one of MCU's best villains in recent years, while Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman share excellent chemistry. Visually distinct and with a unique soundtrack, the formulaic screenplay benefits immensely when focusing on the complex arcs of each character.\r\n\r\nStill, the continuous comedy bits - far from the hilarious creativity of the past - deny further exploration, removing emotional value from the third act. The action featuring generic CGI shadow monsters holds predictable issues, and an irrelevant plot deviation only serves as a teaser for future content.\r\n\r\nOverall, Taika Waititi succeeds yet again, but this time, he fails to reach the full potential of the premise.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+","created_at":"2022-07-08T20:18:51.906Z","id":"62c8912b13a320004c6c0a70","updated_at":"2022-07-08T20:18:51.906Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62c8912b13a320004c6c0a70"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"After a rocky start, _Thor Love and Thunder_ is able to find its footing during delivering a fun and despondent Thor adventure filled with a tremendous amount of heart.\r\nIt is no surprise that this film is far from perfect, and that is not more evident than the beginning of the film. The entire first act feels so disjointed and rushed. You get thrown plot point after plot point and get whipped from planet to planet which results in the viewer not being able to lock in on the story. I really enjoyed the scenes we got from Gorr and Jane during this act, but they felt a little underdeveloped and rushed. The comedy was a little thick during this section, some jokes completely missed, but it was nothing that was overbearing that it hurt the experience. Once the movie enters the second act and begins focusing on Jane the entire gets much better. It is here where you can really see the balance that Taika Waititi brought during Ragnarök with some moments rivaling the best from that film. The ending of this film has some really great action and cinematography, some may argue it's among the best in the MCU. As the movie credits rolled, I was very satisfied to the conclusion of this film and am ready for more Thor action in the future.\r\nThe acting all around was excellent in this film, I found the dynamic between Jane and Thor worked much better than in previous films. They had real chemistry on screen, and you could feel the love the two previously shared unearth with each additional scene. There are some really great conversations that dive into their relationship that were done fantastically. Christian Bale was menacing as Gorr, his demeanor was sinister and completely unhinged as he delivered crazy laughs while delivering his villain manifesto. It gave me serious flashbacks to Heath Ledger’s Joker. I just wish we got to see more of him in the film, but the bit we did see was top tier villainy in the MCU.\r\nThe music in this film blends with the scenes very well. When the Guns N' Roses guitar starts playing you know it is about to go down and I could not help but smile. While the beginning of this film was bad, I can admit, the ending was so great that it averaged out the movie and made it a very enjoyable experience.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_\r\n\r\n**Score:** _7/10_","created_at":"2022-07-09T20:03:28.675Z","id":"62c9df1064de350050dfdb1f","updated_at":"2022-07-15T15:10:20.916Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62c9df1064de350050dfdb1f"},{"author":"Steve Parker","author_details":{"name":"Steve Parker","username":"steveinadelaide l","avatar_path":"/xyE9MCa5m701z6avIlfEgFXmcAx.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"**Thor: Love and Thunder** is a sequel to the 2017 film Thor: Ragnarok. It is written and directed by Taika Waititi and based on, of course, the Marvel Comics by Stan Lee. The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster / Mighty Thor, and Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher.\r\n\r\nAnd the story? The gods are in danger! The God Butcher is coming for them! And only the mightiest of them all can stop him: Thor. But Thor is in bad shape. He's lost his hammer, his friends, and his confidence. He'll need all the help he can get to save the day. He'll have to relearn what it means to be a hero, and Jane Foster will have to become the Mighty Thor.\r\n\r\nI was looking forward to this movie. I loved Taika Waititi's direction in Ragnarok, and the cast is amazing. I was hoping for another fun, fast-paced, and humorous film like its predecessor. But unfortunately, Thor: Love and Thunder falls flat. The story is convoluted and slow-moving, and there are too many characters for any of them to get enough development. The humour is forced, and it frequently fails. And the ending is just...Stranger things have happened, I suppose.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in **Thor: Love and Thunder**. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, you might enjoy it, but if you're looking for another fun and exciting Thor film, I think you'll be disappointed, too.","created_at":"2022-07-10T08:22:58.350Z","id":"62ca8c62e8131d068b119bf7","updated_at":"2022-07-10T08:22:58.350Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62ca8c62e8131d068b119bf7"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"This was my favourite of the Marvel franchises, but boy have we now plumbed the depths. Taika Waititi presents us here with a mess of a film that dumps just about all of the original exciting Norse mythology and legend, and substitutes it with something little better than a cartoon. Chris Hemsworth does try quite hard, and nobody could ever doubt Christian Bale's commitment to his roles - he must have lost half his bodyweight as he portrays the emaciated \"Gorr\". This poor fellow loses his daughter but has hopes that his local god will step in. Nope, as Jordan Peele might have said, and as the evil necro-sword mysteriously appears in his hand, he duly dispatches this thoughtless immortal and thereby vows to do the same for all the rest. When several Asgardian children are kidnapped and taken to the shadowland, it falls to Thor, \"King Valkyrie\" (Tessa Thompson) and the newly empowered - but terminally ill - \"Jane\" (Natalie Portman) to thwart this plan. Along the way, they try to recruit some other gods from different pantheons - notably Zeus (a hammily absurd Russell Crowe) but ultimately it's all down to these three to save the day. There is a bit of humour at the start - and maybe Jane Fonda would have been an useful addition, but for the most part this film is neither one thing nor another with too much romance - a serious illness that just didn't belong in a light-heated fantasy film that treats death as an occupational hazard for the characters; and the need to generate and sustain the supporting characters reduced the impact of Thor to little more than a team player in a red cape. The ending is weak, but frankly no more so than most of the rest of this truly disappointing feature. If you stick right to the end of the credits, you will see that perhaps Hercules is to be the next topic for this character - I can only hope Sir Kenneth Branagh is available. Looks great on a big screen, superb visual effects etc., but Marvel have lost their way with this...","created_at":"2022-07-11T20:05:19.711Z","id":"62cc827fe8d0280052f1c8e1","updated_at":"2022-07-11T20:05:19.711Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62cc827fe8d0280052f1c8e1"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"To be fair, Waititi has some really funny material in _Love and Thunder_. Everyone in the extremely talented cast looks to be having a ton of fun and the villain is out of this world good. The events of the film feel kind of pointless, especially with repeat viewings. Phase four of the MCU has this aimless direction that is heading towards a ton of projects that no one is really all that excited for. After Endgame and Spider-Man: No Way Home, it honestly feels like the MCU has reached its peak. _Thor: Love and Thunder_ is mostly just a brightly colored filler episode that will likely be forgotten about like most of the _Thor_ franchise.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Thor-Love-and-Thunder-2022-Review-Taika-Waititi-Overload","created_at":"2022-07-13T00:39:44.724Z","id":"62ce1450e62719004cabaaae","updated_at":"2022-07-13T00:39:44.724Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62ce1450e62719004cabaaae"},{"author":"Kokoryan","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Kokoryan","avatar_path":null,"rating":null},"content":"The worst Thor movie what I ever seen...","created_at":"2022-07-31T17:44:25.153Z","id":"62e6bf79d5dbc2005edbbd68","updated_at":"2022-08-15T16:19:07.745Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62e6bf79d5dbc2005edbbd68"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**It’s definitely worth seeing but doesn’t quite reach the height of its predecessor.**\r\n\r\nThis is a tough movie to explain.

Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman all make for good support. Christian Bale is also someone I enjoyed, I like the look of his character but kinda felt that I wanted to see more of him - it's like we see a beginning and an end, but part of me feels like we coulda had something in-between.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are solid, as is the music; even if the track choices aren't the most creative. I probably would've shortened the run time a little, though that isn't anything all that noteworthy to be honest.

Little do they know, though, that he has applied to join the \"Vicious Six\" who have, themselves, just dumped their founder member \"Wild Knuckles\". They aren't so impressed when he turns up at the interview but he uses his newly designed glue-gun to escape with their all powerful, emerald encrusted, stone. Now the five are on the warpath as he entrusts the stone to his minion friend \"Otto\", but he manages to swap it for a pebble with eyes so now embarks on a mammoth cycle ride to fetch it back whilst the pursuing villains cause havoc. Luckily, \"Wild Knuckles\" hasn't given up. He kidnaps \"Gru\" to get the stone back, but when he realises that he no longer has it, the two form an unlikely, and quite amusing, partnership to retrieve it. I guess I'm just the wrong demographic for this, because although it hits the ground running and never stops for breath, I just didn't really get it. The yellow ovoid creatures are fun, but hardy the stuff of big screen entertainment and the plot reminded me of the recently released \"Bad Guys\" animation that I didn't much like either. It's my first foray into \"Despicable\" territory, but the slapstick approach to the whole thing will probably ensure it's my last. Others will love it, I'm sure - the cinema on a Sunday night was packed to the rafters, but this hadn't enough for the grown up in me to remain engaged for long.","created_at":"2022-07-04T05:48:42.396Z","id":"62c27f3a28723c2215c481b2","updated_at":"2022-07-04T09:36:22.529Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62c27f3a28723c2215c481b2"},{"author":"All Things Movies and TV","author_details":{"name":"All Things Movies and TV","username":"allthingsmoviesandtv","avatar_path":"/bzMQdxbDss9OmYfDGD5WuwOEY3k.png","rating":8.0},"content":"It sure has been a long wait for the sequel (7 years to be precise) but I think it's safe to say that the film does not disappoint.

Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in “Spider-Man: No Way Home”.\r\n\r\nTaking place where “Spider-Man: Far From Home” ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.\r\n\r\nAs if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.\r\n\r\nDesperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.\r\n\r\nAs more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.\r\n\r\nThere is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-12-15T15:35:00.071Z","id":"61ba0b24d1444300413e2cbe","updated_at":"2021-12-15T15:35:00.071Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61ba0b24d1444300413e2cbe"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/spider-man-no-way-home-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the darkest, saddest, emotionally draining entries in the MCU, surpassing all of my expectations.\r\n\r\nDespite a messy, convoluted first half with some pacing issues and occasionally frustrating, poorly placed humor, Jon Watts, Chris McKenna, and Erik Sommers more than compensate these minor issues with some of the best (and brutally violent) Spider-Man action ever witnessed on screen.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the surprisingly coherent narrative packs shocking developments and actually offers enough screentime for the villains to significantly impact Peter Parker's arc.

I was not expecting to love this film as much as I do! It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.\r\n\r\nThe cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of <em>'Spider-Man'</em> - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.\r\n\r\nZendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.\r\n\r\nOnto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.\r\n\r\nThis really is top tier Marvel!

I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this naïve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.\r\n\r\nIn addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?\r\n\r\nThe good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.\r\n\r\nInstead they just piled on the childish, naïve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable.","created_at":"2022-06-26T16:34:15.607Z","id":"62b88a8767203d0d3888ba62","updated_at":"2022-06-26T16:34:15.607Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62b88a8767203d0d3888ba62"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"This movie brings it from start to finish, there is not a dull moment in this film, and we truly see the birth of a new Spider-Man.

The massive combined gravitas generated by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it’s barely a film at all to begin with – it’s more like the superhero equivalent of that Pink Panther movie they made with spare parts from previous Pink Panther movies.\r\n\r\nIf I want Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, why not just revisit 2002’s Spider-Man? Similarly, if I have a hankering for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, why not just rewatch 2004’s Spider-Man 2? The latter was, according to Roger Ebert, “the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with \"Superman\"”. How the mighty have fallen. It’s great to see Dafoe and Molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty – or rather the nostalgia – wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior Sam Raimi’s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then.\r\n\r\nWhen Molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, Doc Ock’s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices – first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to Spider-Man 2, which used CGI to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, Molina was digitally de-aged (as was Dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example The Irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, Doc Ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the MCU Spider-Man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human – and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor – than any of the heroes with the exception of Tobey Maguire, and while Spider-Man may prevail over Norman Osborne, Dafoe totally obliterates Holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work – and not even the best work at that – of a much more talented filmmaker. To put it bluntly, Spider-Man: No Way Home has absolutely no reason for being.","created_at":"2022-08-28T04:01:56.994Z","id":"630ae8b432489b007e863578","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:31:52.604Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630ae8b432489b007e863578"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":14},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1589918,"title":"Spider-Man: No Way Home","original_title":"Spider-Man: No Way Home","plot_overview":"Peter Parker is unmasked and no longer able to separate his normal life from the high-stakes of being a super-hero.

(Chris Pratt) and \"Claire\" (Bryce Dallas Howard) are living in the remote wilderness with \"Maisie\" (Isabella Sermon), whom they are desperate to protect. From what? Well it turns out she is a bit of a miraculous conception from the \"Lockwood\" dynasty that co-founded the original park with \"Hammond\" and is very much on the radar of corporate megalomanic \"Dodgson\" (Campbell Scott) whose company is devising super-engineered locusts to devour great swathes of crops across the United States that are not grown from their own brand of seed. This is where \"Sattler\" (Laura Dern) comes in. She is convinced of this dastardly plan, but must compare the DNA of one from his lab with one they secured in the wild so she can prove it. Her plan enlists the help of old pal \"Grant\" (Sam Neill) and with the help of their intellectual nemesis \"Malcolm\" (a suitably contrarian effort from Jeff Goldblum) they secure an invitation to the company's sanctuary in the Italian Dolomites. Meantime, the young girl is abducted from her wintry home, as is the baby of velociraptor \"Blue\" and so Pratt and Howard have to track them down, and that takes them on some quickly paced, but hardly original, set piece adventures where they meet pilot \"Kayla\" (DeWanda Wise). She chips in to help them in what now reminded me of aspects of the Brendan Fraser \"Mummy\" films, before they also end up in the Italian mountains. Can they team up and thwart the cunning plan? The problem with this, is that there are just way too many characters and too many weakly constructed threads to the story going on. It's all too diffuse and serendipity in the last hour or so just takes far too great a hand in the way the narrative combines and develops. The dinosaur effects are still amazing, but oddly enough I felt them less effective than in previous iterations - there just aren't enough scenes that feature them and when they do, they are just under-used. Pratt is always good value for me, but here he looks out of sorts and hardly features at all; Scott just doesn't cut it as the malevolent baddie (though could his character be the same guy who tried to buy the specimens in the first film?) and Sam Neill relies too much on his bemused facial expressions - indeed his best work on this is pretty much all included in the trailers. It looks great on big screen, includes a few bars now and again from John Williams masterful 1993 score, but for the main part this is a pretty mediocre conclusion to a great franchise with an ending that is rushed and entirely predictable.","created_at":"2022-06-13T09:01:31.965Z","id":"62a6fceb7f6c8d77b97d440e","updated_at":"2022-06-13T09:05:44.404Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62a6fceb7f6c8d77b97d440e"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":3.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/jurassic-world-dominion-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Jurassic World Dominion is a massive disappointment on virtually every level. With an incredibly captivating premise, Colin Trevorrow ignores the fascinating years of mankind trying to deal with the chaos of dinosaurs repopulating Earth, opting instead to write a generic, formulaic, surprisingly tedious screenplay.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the lousy character treatment, the cast is divided into two storylines focused on nonsensical, bland rescue and espionage missions, placing dinosaurs on the back burner during the excessively long runtime.\r\n\r\nAction sequences reach drastically low entertainment levels, sometimes imperceptible due to erratic camera work and choppy editing.\r\n\r\nThe cast, visuals, and score might save this from being a complete trainwreck, but not from miserably failing to deliver an epic conclusion to a saga that deserved nothing less than that.\"\r\n\r\nRating: D","created_at":"2022-06-14T20:50:41.062Z","id":"62a8f4a1875d1a31ec5f9412","updated_at":"2022-06-14T20:50:41.062Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62a8f4a1875d1a31ec5f9412"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"With _Jurassic World Dominion_, a _Jurassic World_ film where dinosaurs are now free and interacting with the modern world shouldn’t feel this long-winded or this tiresome. There are a few action sequences that are worthwhile and Jeff Goldblum has a few great one-liners (“You made a promise to a dinosaur?”), but the film is a monumental disappointment overall.\r\n\r\nThe film has already made over $415 million at the worldwide box office, so the interest in the franchise is still there. But the chemistry between the cast is almost non-existent and it feels like the film is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel. If the _Jurassic Park/Jurassic World_ franchise is to continue, it desperately needs to go in a refreshing and unseen direction. Now that all of the nostalgia is out of the way, fans deserve a refreshing and unique adventure over what is otherwise a glorified rehash.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Jurassic-World-Dominion-2022-Review-You-Cant-Squeeze-Fun-From-a-Fossil","created_at":"2022-06-16T14:00:22.575Z","id":"62ab3776134d5800998353d7","updated_at":"2022-06-16T14:00:22.575Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62ab3776134d5800998353d7"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"<em>'Jurassic World Dominion'</em> is far from perfect, if just about entertaining to watch... kinda.\r\n\r\nI'm not fully convinced by it but I do think there's enough in there that's worth watching. There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.\r\n\r\nStill, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.\r\n\r\nThe run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.\r\n\r\nI'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.","created_at":"2022-07-13T16:35:31.330Z","id":"62cef4538a84d200502b989c","updated_at":"2022-07-13T16:35:31.330Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62cef4538a84d200502b989c"},{"author":"Peter McGinn","author_details":{"name":"Peter McGinn","username":"narrator56","avatar_path":"/tVbrLJzA2RwRlE7dJLJG54UsAkq.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"So after watching the first four movies in this franchise (three of which I had seen more than once, I finally watched this most recent effort. There are similarities and differences between Dominion and the earlier ones.\r\n\r\nIt held some of the usual elements: a child for us to care when they placed her in danger; the ability of the heroes (even the child) to outrun dinosaurs under a blind panic; walking dinosaur food, also known as bad guys; and references to the original theme park that started it all. They outdid themselves this time - keep an eye out for the Barbasol shaving cream canister.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are plenty of differences also. Parts of it weren’t even recognizable as part of the franchise. They juggle plot lines around the dinosaurs, the ethics of genetic engineering, a child clone kidnapping, industrial malfeasance, and what for me was the most interesting subplot and most closely tied to the original film: the struggle for humans and dinosaurs to co-exist under the new planetary paradigm. \r\n\r\nAnother difference is that there are two romances developing throughout the film.\r\n\r\nAn improvement is the return of characters we know well: Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant are back, and Ian Malcolm is present long enough to get in a few of his witticisms, unlike in the last movie.\r\n\r\nSo ultimately I found Dominion to be entertaining enough to stick with it, though the aspects that might have been intended to make me think just sort of got in the way.","created_at":"2022-08-07T14:50:09.229Z","id":"62efd1217d5504007e4b6dc7","updated_at":"2022-08-15T13:20:58.707Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62efd1217d5504007e4b6dc7"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**Not as bad as reviews say, but go in with reasonable expectations.**\r\n\r\nAs the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy, it, unfortunately, had similarities to Rise of Skywalker.

Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.\r\n\r\nI really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen “big companies are bad” story with dinosaurs thrown in.\r\n\r\nThe story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack. Things more or less just happen and the “heroes” fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the “heroes” doesn’t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?\r\n\r\nIdiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.\r\n\r\nThey brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.\r\n\r\nIt is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today’s Hollywood morons. I’ve been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real, life like dinosaurs it was just wow. But now, not even the special effects can save this movie. It is not a good movie, plain and simple.","created_at":"2022-10-23T12:36:12.701Z","id":"6355353c880c9200796de089","updated_at":"2022-10-23T12:36:12.798Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6355353c880c9200796de089"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":8},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1195869,"title":"Jurassic

Naru sees evidence of his work and tries to convince the tribe\r\nthat the carnage they are finding is not the work of a bear or a\r\nmountain lion as the community believes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the nature of the threat manifests itself, Naru must find the\r\ncourage and skills to track and face the enemy who threatens to destroy\r\nher tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe film is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and he mixes a good amount of\r\naction along with a very interesting setting and characters to create an\r\nengaging tale.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some moments that the FX was not as sharp as one might expect\r\nbut the sequences with the Predator are filled with action and suspense\r\nand should make fans of the franchise very happy. The film at times does\r\nrequire some leaps of faith from the audience but in the end, “Prey” is\r\na satisfying film that is superior to “The Predator” and rates as one of\r\nthe stronger entries in the series and that the franchise is in good\r\nhands for the future.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to see where the franchise goes next as there is lots of material for the franchise to explore, but for now, “Prey” is a refreshing take on the series and one fans should enjoy.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2022-08-06T15:25:08.810Z","id":"62ee87d477e1f6007ad3a5a8","updated_at":"2022-08-06T15:25:08.920Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62ee87d477e1f6007ad3a5a8"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/prey-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Prey lives up to high expectations, being the first movie in the Predator saga to come close to or even surpass the original.\r\n\r\nDan Trachtenberg is able to restore the franchise by focusing on a compelling protagonist and the motivational essence of the primary creature, as well as creating one of the most dazzling films of 2022.\r\n\r\nBoth the cinematography and the score take advantage of the on-location filmmaking to create an almost epic atmosphere, whether through gorgeous wide shots that will leave every viewer amazed or through violent, macabre, exceptionally choreographed action sequences in conjunction with long takes.\r\n\r\nAmber Midthunder delivers one of the best performances of her career.\r\n\r\nFor fans of the saga, horror, and/or action, it's not easy to find something better this year.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2022-08-07T22:37:33.825Z","id":"62f03eadc4ad59007a1564d3","updated_at":"2022-08-07T22:37:33.949Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62f03eadc4ad59007a1564d3"},{"author":"MovieGuys","author_details":{"name":"","username":"MovieGuys","avatar_path":null,"rating":4.0},"content":"Sometimes it's best to let the dead rest in peace and such is the case, with the much exhumed, Predator franchise. The original has, quite deservedly,become a cult classic. What came after ranges from passable to truly awful acts of grave robbing. \r\n\r\nPrey is not awful. It has wonderful cinematic's and a superficially believable, 18th century world. A world on the cusp of modernisation and change but one that still holds on to, the fading reality embraced by  its native inhabitants. \r\n\r\nRegrettably, that's far as we get. What comes after is a revisionist construct, that does not reflect life, as it was, in this era. Instead we get feminism, at a time when its presence would have been akin, to finding an automatic wrist watch, in an Egyptian tomb. \r\n\r\nIf by some miracle you can overlook this nonsensical plot turn, it doesn't get any better. Our hero, a slim young girl, apparently has the wherewithal to take on and defeat, a savage interplanetary killer. A killer, as we can recall from the first film, who chewed through all but one member, of a hardcore team, of special forces mercenaries.\r\n\r\nSure, Arnie's character did use old style tactics, in the end, to defeat the beast. That said, he's a huge, profoundly physical man, cast as someone with no end of combat training and even then he barely made it out alive.\r\n\r\nNo matter, old world patriarchy defying girl, who has to run like stink from a simple bear the predator easily dispatches, magically gets the job done.\r\n\r\nDo I need say more? If utter suspension of disbelief is your thing this just might work for you. My advice, watch or re-watch the original and suspend your disbelief that the spin offs that came after, were ever made. \r\n\r\n\r\n4/10.","created_at":"2022-08-14T03:23:14.981Z","id":"62f86aa2258823007f60451f","updated_at":"2022-08-14T21:06:54.039Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62f86aa2258823007f60451f"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"I guess I have to start by saying that this movie was a lot better than some of the latest entries in the Predator franchise but then, that is not really difficult so it does not say that much. Personally, I think this movie is rather mediocre.\r\n\r\nCinematically it is not a bad movie. I liked the footage for the most part. Story wise, well, for the first half of the movie I found it rather boring actually.\r\n\r\nThere was some brief scenes with a wolf and later a bear that had some action in it but for the most part the main protagonist ran around moping and whining and trying to pretend to be worthy of being a great warrior. Somewhat unrealistic of course since Hollywood, of course, had cast a woman in the role. Not that I have anything against it per see but at the time this movie is supposed to happen a women, native Indian or not, stayed at home doing the chores whether Hollywood tries to pretend otherwise or not.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I m still okay with that but she spends most of the time fumbling, stumbling and when a threat comes around she runs and looks scared. Not the kind of great warrior charisma that I was hoping for in the main protagonist.\r\n\r\nWhen it finally starts to get interesting she stumbles into a bloody animal trap and gets caught by a hunting party. The latter which of course is portrayed as the typical Hollywood stereotype of “white man bad”. Minor details like, having your foot caught in that kind of steel trap would render you useless for the rest of the movie, is of course ignored.\r\n\r\nThe later half of the movie has some action in it at least which is dragged down by the main protagonists moping and the fact that, when she finally has the chance of taking a shot, she just stares stupidly for half a minute and voila, the chance is gone.\r\n\r\nOn the good side is that the actors are doing a pretty decent job of the not so great script they were given and, as I mentioned, cinematically it is a quite good movie. The action, when it happens, is pretty good if one ignores the Hollywood stupidities and the not so kick-behind main protagonist.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie is watchable and, as I wrote, better than previous instalments in the franchise but that is about it.","created_at":"2022-08-14T09:52:10.573Z","id":"62f8c5ca25882300821fe9ec","updated_at":"2022-08-14T09:52:10.647Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62f8c5ca25882300821fe9ec"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"OK. Please explain. Is this just supposed to be \"Pocahontas\" meets \"Predator\"? Just because it calls itself an \"origin\" story doesn't mean it needed to be made - and I'm sorry, but I just didn't understand whom this is for. It has none of the suspense or tension of the original Arnie film from 1987, and I kept expecting Peabo Bryson to burst into song at some point as these hopelessly out-gunned/arrowed/tomahawked Commanche - and, to be fair, most of their critter counterparts, seem to be on the menu of this visiting alien creature who has invisibility, enduring strength and some pretty whizzy weapons at his disposal. It is a little bit gory, but no more so that you might see on your latest Blumhouse effort, and to be fair it doesn't hang about - there is plenty of action once it gets started. The acting, however, is really neither here nor there and of course, there isn't the slightest degree of jeopardy as the whole thing sort of lurches along to a quirkily silly ending that made me smile. The effects are pretty old hat and though the human characters are tenacious and courageous enough, the story has just too much of the ridiculous David and Goliath to it. I did wonder why it didn't get a cinema release, but now I have seen it, I reckon I know why. It's watchable enough, but I can't say it's much good or the least memorable.","created_at":"2022-08-15T11:00:25.963Z","id":"62fa27492588230082205172","updated_at":"2022-08-15T11:00:26.087Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62fa27492588230082205172"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"**Overall : Prey brings new life to the Predator series, and I hope there is more to come.**\r\n\r\nThe Predator franchise has been all over the map when it comes to quality, settings, and story. With entries ranging from the incredible 1987 Predator to the awful 2018 attempt, The Predator. Thankfully, Prey shines as the best film in the Predator series since the original. This prequel takes a while to get going as it establishes character motivations and the dangers of the Great Plains. But once it gets going, it just gets better and better! Prey remains faithful to the original, blending horror and action with the elusive alien killer eliminating its prey one by one. But this time, the improved effects and primitive setting make the action more visceral and scary. I could go on and on about how brilliantly the time period raised the stakes, how excellent Amber Midthunder’s heroine was, or how fantastic Dan Trachtenberg’s directing was. Prey returns the Predator franchise to its best form by avoiding the cheese and focusing on the horror of the hunt.","created_at":"2022-08-19T23:01:05.445Z","id":"630016311c6aa7007ffc0f46","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:10:02.702Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630016311c6aa7007ffc0f46"},{"author":"d54.pod","author_details":{"name":"","username":"d54.pod","avatar_path":"/uXrNG01ypj3C4UY6vlaLpacNfAf.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Full review: open.spotify.com/episode/3MS52tXr7jHbZxxWsx62tO?si=1554552c2fb542cd\r\n\r\nI came into this movie with some apprehension due to how much I enjoyed the original Predator movie from 1987. My biggest concern was would they ruin the legacy left by the original movie, mostly due to the fact that this is a prequel, unlike the other's in the franchise. However, I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nThere is so much to like about this movie, from its beautiful scenery, the highly entertaining action sequences, the stellar acting (led by Amber Midthunder) and how it actually paid homage to the original. The story, much like the original was simple and got straight to the point, and it didn't overcomplicate anything with lengthy or unnecessary dialogue. It also didn't do overboard with the easter eggs and references. I really cant excuse movies which make you pause to show off references to previous instalments of the franchise, even at times when they dont make sense. This movie did none of that which was refreshing.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend this movie. If the younger generation was to watch movie first and follow up with the original from 1987, it would not be a disservice at all. Looking forward to the sequel to this and seeing how they tie in more of the predator lore.","created_at":"2022-09-07T07:23:52.077Z","id":"63184708924ce6007ab4de92","updated_at":"2022-09-08T15:30:47.520Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63184708924ce6007ab4de92"},{"author":"[robbie grawey]","author_details":{"name":"[robbie grawey]","username":"robbiegrawey","avatar_path":"/qB7lELWBr2iNbKu3eYBI2bxzJ7I.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Pretty gnarly and also pretty great!\r\nSad I didn't get to see it in a theater :(","created_at":"2022-09-12T21:11:49.774Z","id":"631fa09567dcc90082828c17","updated_at":"2022-09-16T20:39:01.477Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/631fa09567dcc90082828c17"},{"author":"Peter McGinn","author_details":{"name":"Peter McGinn","username":"narrator56","avatar_path":"/tVbrLJzA2RwRlE7dJLJG54UsAkq.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"I didn’t have a frame of reference for this movie, never having watched a predator movie, or indeed hardly any movies in the thriller-action-adventure genre.

imaginative, incredibly entertaining work.\r\n\r\nThe humor related to the protagonist's misfortunes induces some moments of laughter, but even these are cliches repeated countless times throughout the history of cinema. Strangely, the 3D animation fails to offer expressiveness and emotion to the characters, being limited to the beautiful environment that surrounds the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe score tries to elevate the overall film with sentimental tunes and melodies, but unfortunately, it's not enough to avoid the first animated disappointment of the year.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C","created_at":"2022-08-12T21:17:21.583Z","id":"62f6c361c3bffe008776f60b","updated_at":"2022-08-12T21:17:21.679Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62f6c361c3bffe008776f60b"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**Overall : Luck feels as warm and familiar as a favorite blanket reminding us of some of our favorite Pixar movies from 25 years ago.**\r\n\r\nA sweet movie with a sweet message. John Lasseter’s return to animation felt like a return to the Pixar stories of the 90s - hope-filled stories about finding meaningful friendships and family. Luck had moments of laughter and moments that touched your heart. It didn’t rise to the level of Toy Story or Finding Nemo, but it is definitely a good one. My three-year-old immediately wanted to start it over again when it ended, and she loved the fun creatures and bright-colored worlds. So it looks like Luck will be around the house quite a bit for the next few months.","created_at":"2022-08-19T22:58:16.017Z","id":"630015877d41aa007e386efc","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:09:23.701Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630015877d41aa007e386efc"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"In theory, this ought to have been much better - but somehow it just doesn't ever get going. The story centres around \"Sam\" who has the most damnable ill-luck. If it can go wrong for her (and those around her) then you can bet your last lucky penny then it will! Sitting, despondently, outside a café one day, she shares her sandwich with a black cat and thereafter her adventures start as she discovers this cat comes from the land of luck. Good luck, actually, reigned over benignly by the dragon (Jane Fonda). As with everything, though, it's an equilibrium and there is a fine balance to be had with bad luck - which they try to contain in a machine. Her arrival spells doom for this finely stable environment. Soon she and the cat \"Bob\" are having to spin plates a-plenty to stop their universe collapsing into chaos. It's far too wordy and worthy - the sentiment was all just a bit too sweet, sugary and over-whelming for me. It is a perfectly adequate production and the animation does enough, but at 1¾ it's all just to thinly stretched out and actually quite slow. It will be fine for the kids on the television at Christmas, but it's very limited cinema release speaks volumes...","created_at":"2022-08-29T05:30:35.099Z","id":"630c4efb6e938a007bf2c03a","updated_at":"2022-08-29T05:30:35.193Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630c4efb6e938a007bf2c03a"},{"author":"[robbie grawey]","author_details":{"name":"[robbie grawey]","username":"robbiegrawey","avatar_path":"/qB7lELWBr2iNbKu3eYBI2bxzJ7I.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"A bit of a snooze, but not without its charms","created_at":"2022-09-12T21:13:01.021Z","id":"631fa0ddbd3209007ad158ad","updated_at":"2022-09-16T20:39:00.283Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/631fa0ddbd3209007ad158ad"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4}},{"id":1565515,"title":"Luck","original_title":"Luck","plot_overview":"Suddenly finding herself in the never-before-seen Land of Luck, the unluckiest person in the world must unite with the magical creatures there to turn her luck around.","type":"movie","runtime_minutes":105,"year":2022,"end_year":null,"release_date":"2022-08-05","imdb_id":"tt7214954","tmdb_id":585511,"tmdb_type":"movie","genres":[3,2,4,9],"genre_names":["Adventure","Animation","Comedy","Fantasy"],"user_rating":6.8,"critic_score":49,"us_rating":"G","poster":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/posters/01565515_poster_w185.jpg","backdrop":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/backdrops/01565515_bd_w780.jpg","original_language":"en","similar_titles":[1441038,1441039,168105,1132158,1390081,1224925,1585899,1420686,1418000,115147,1149386,1274508,1377018,1266089,1169240,1209559,1583857,1348722,1337546,1565932,1565136,1163170,1598520,16873,1420687],"networks":null,"network_names":[],"relevance_percentile":99.7,"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSG5UX0EQVg","trailer_thumbnail":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/video_thumbnails/662397_pthumbnail_320.jpg","sources":[{"source_id":371,"name":"AppleTV+","type":"sub","region":"US","ios_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","android_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","web_url":"https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/luck/umc.cmc.5w6fq1u39v7ozsdv3jkx0nrfs?&itscg=30200&at=1010layx","format":"HD","price":null,"seasons":null,"episodes":null}]}],[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/askg3SMvhqEl4OL52YuvdtY40Yb.jpg","belongs_to_collection":null,"budget":175000000,"genres":[{"id":10751,"name":"Family"},{"id":16,"name":"Animation"},{"id":14,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":10402,"name":"Music"},{"id":35,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":12,"name":"Adventure"}],"homepage":"https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/coco","id":354912,"imdb_id":"tt2380307","original_language":"en","original_title":"Coco","overview":"Despite his family’s baffling generations-old ban on music, Miguel dreams of becoming an accomplished musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz.

Great voice acting, great songs without having the burden of exposition via song that you find in the more musical ventures by Disney.  I loved that you could see genuine guitar chords being played, so often in live action films the playing of musical instruments, especially guitar are poorly faked.  None of that in this animated gem.\r\n\r\nOne thing I personally loved was the depiction of Mexican culture.  Although I really enjoyed _Moana_, I thought it was a little bit too much of a pastiche of multiple Pacific cultures when it should have just picked one (Maori) and stuck with it.  _Coco_ celebrates Mexican culture, and depicts it well.  The only thing missing for me was more Mexican cuisine.\r\n\r\nIt can get a little dark in places, so maybe be careful when watching it with the little ones, but should appeal to most of the family.\r\n\r\n9/10","created_at":"2018-05-27T10:05:29.634Z","id":"5b0a82e99251411e6a004bc1","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:08.912Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b0a82e99251411e6a004bc1"},{"author":"priya_","author_details":{"name":"","username":"priya_","avatar_path":"/tIuVweidHnUWaOrKngrvkzLv6o5.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"I loved the movie starting from the characters, animation, colors, emotions, story everything.

Safe to say, I was not expecting this film to smash it out the park - which it totally does. This is why I don't, personally, look up about films before watching them, I love being surprised.\r\n\r\nBig credit also goes to the cast, who play some awesome characters. From Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) to Héctor (Gael García Bernal) to Ernesto (Benjamin Bratt), among others, they are all very, very good.\r\n\r\nIt isn't just the characters that make this memorable, it is also the excellent plot which is told beautifully. It's filled with not just comedy but also a load of heart - there's a few nicely done twists too. The world that they create around the Day of the Dead is fantastic, while the music fits perfectly.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, you must watch this!

Action-wise, it lacks the energy and creativity necessary to entertain most viewers, despite the dedicated stunt work.\r\n\r\nA tad frustrating in retrospect.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C-","created_at":"2022-08-25T22:06:54.211Z","id":"6307f27ee18b97007bda31ea","updated_at":"2022-08-25T22:06:54.310Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6307f27ee18b97007bda31ea"},{"author":"MovieGuys","author_details":{"name":"","username":"MovieGuys","avatar_path":null,"rating":6.0},"content":"Samaritan is a by the numbers action flick but that's not necessarily a bad thing. \r\n\r\nOne of the key problems with a lot of modern movie making, is the constant need to experiment and at times, inject social messages into what it supposed to be entertainment. \r\n\r\nSamaritan follows a well known and well worn, by the numbers, action film formula. It tries to throw in a twist I saw coming pretty early on but that's alright. In essence, this film is inherently watchable. Stallone still has excellent screen presence and the chemistry, between him and the young boy, works well.\r\n\r\nMy advice, ignore the carping from the soy latte class of movie goers who bemoan a lack of sophistication. Its often the simple things in life that are most enjoyable and this is one of them. \r\n\r\nIn summary, Samaritan wont win any accolades for high brow cinema but what it does, it does competently enough to be reasonably enjoyable and entertaining. For many of us, tired of shallow cinema sophistry and intellectual pretension, that's what really matters.","created_at":"2022-08-28T22:21:01.708Z","id":"630bea4db3e627007a652cc0","updated_at":"2022-08-28T22:21:01.807Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630bea4db3e627007a652cc0"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"\"Sam\" (Javon Walton) lives with his mum in a run down housing project in Granite City (no, not Aberdeen) where he is frequently bullied. After the timely intervention of his neighbour \"Mr. Smith\" (Sylvester Stallone) the youngster starts to believe that his rescuer may be none other than the eponymous super-hero who went missing some twenty years earlier. Could he be back to save the city from terminal decline at the hands of his \"Nemesis\"? Well despite the reticence of \"Smith\", the young man is determined that he can cajole his newfound friend into saving society. As the pair start to bond, we realise that this young man is decent and has potential and that his elderly chum has quite a few skeletons in his closet - though perhaps not quite the ones anyone is expecting. Sadly, though the young Walton is quite effective, the underused Stallone is just going through the motions and the story is an amalgam of loads of other DC/Marvel style affairs with some fairly pedestrian writing underpinning a disappointingly under-developed story. The ending has a twist but it's not really enough to redeem the rest of this rather predictable effort that, though it looks fine, is all pretty forgettable fayre from all concerned.","created_at":"2022-08-29T19:29:22.218Z","id":"630d1392ede1b0007ed56da5","updated_at":"2022-08-29T19:29:22.321Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630d1392ede1b0007ed56da5"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3}},{"id":1588152,"title":"Samaritan","original_title":"Samaritan","plot_overview":"Thirteen year old Sam Cleary  suspects that his mysteriously reclusive neighbor Mr. Smith is actually the legendary vigilante Samaritan, who was reported dead 20 years ago.

The film is at is most bewitching when Sam Raimi can let his horror roots be showcased. It will satisfy horror and superhero film fans alike, but would have and could have been even better if Raimi was allowed to dive even further into the horror genre. Be sure to stay after the credits, as well.

Never has a film from the cinematic universe been so violent, bloody, and terrifying.\r\n\r\nBenedict Cumberbatch and especially Elizabeth Olsen carry the complex story about the multiverse through Michael Waldron's flawed screenplay. The balance between the various storylines could be better, America Chavez is just one MacGuffin to reach another MacGuffin, and the journey through the multiple universes only compensates for the mind-blowing visual effects.\r\n\r\nSome personal disappointment is associated with the cameos treatment and the lack of real-location filming. Overall, more was expected from what was supposed to be Phase Four's \"big movie\", but it's a solid entry into the top half of the franchise.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2022-05-06T21:57:58.027Z","id":"627599e61b1f3c0051e4d96d","updated_at":"2022-05-06T21:57:58.027Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/627599e61b1f3c0051e4d96d"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Whilst I really did quite enjoy this - and it was great to be in a busy cinema again - it's really more of a testament to the skills of the VFX guys rather than to any of the writers. The story is really pretty thin with the engaging and confident Benedict Cumberbatch joining forces with the charismatic and feisty young Xochitl Gomez' \"America\" - a young lady who has been appearing in his dreams. Turns out, she can cross from one universe to another - and soon both are being sought by the mighty Elizabeth Olsen's \"Wanda Maximoff\" (surely a \"Bond\" girl?) who wants control of time so she can get back to her lost family, yada yada... Benedict Wong features sparingly, but always adds a little value as the \"Sorcerer Supreme\" and there are a few cameos from Charlize Theron and Sir Patrick Stewart to help prop up what is, admittedly, a pretty meagre second half. I think this multiverse strand could provide Marvel with the gift that keeps on giving, but they have got to tighten the pace up - two hours for this was just too long; the plot doesn't sustain it and though the combat scenes are nothing to the length in the \"Avengers\" movies; there is still far too much slack here. It does look and sound great on a big screen, though, and I am now warming to the star in the role (and his intuitive flying cape). Fun, but flawed.","created_at":"2022-05-29T14:22:26.864Z","id":"629381a2cddbbc74b3081465","updated_at":"2022-05-29T14:27:53.537Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/629381a2cddbbc74b3081465"},{"author":"Peter McGinn","author_details":{"name":"Peter McGinn","username":"narrator56","avatar_path":"/tVbrLJzA2RwRlE7dJLJG54UsAkq.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"Obviously this film came loaded with the usual great special effects and endless battle scenes that I guess are needed to draw and hold your average superhero movie fan. Not so much of the Marvel wit and humor that are more like to hold me, the anything but average fan, or rather,not a fan at all, though I do like science fiction.\r\n\r\nFor me, the 500 pound elephant in the room that cast a shadow over the entire movie was the villain. Now if you haven’t seen the film yet this may count as a spoiler, though it is revealed fairly early on. But the former heroine turned evil one is a woman taken over by the dark side. But what got me was her motive. Not to take over the world or the universe or the multiverse, but rather because she wanted to be a mommy to kids she lost along the way, or never had, or something. Billions of people in multiple universes died because she didn’t want to adopt. \r\n\r\nIt seems like inserting herself into one universe might have been enough for you or me, but I suppose she wanted more options open if something went wrong with the first kids whose mother she killed (or is it her alternate self?) to get hold of. Dr. Strange even asked about it once, and she blithely explained that if her new old kids got terribly sick, she could find the cure for anything in other universes. She is the perfect mom, doing anything for her kids; well, except for providing moral leadership and showing them the path to be a good person who helps others and contributes to the world around them. Yeah, do as I say, kids, not as I do. \r\n\r\nWhoever created the evil dark book that took over her personality would have been disappointed that it was used merely to seed a new family.","created_at":"2022-06-29T09:23:55.531Z","id":"62bc1a2b7304b523856b7f96","updated_at":"2022-07-05T23:37:01.302Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62bc1a2b7304b523856b7f96"},{"author":"tim.uruski","author_details":{"name":"","username":"tim.uruski","avatar_path":null,"rating":null},"content":"This is a good movie.

Somehow they managed to take a perfectly acceptable character and transform it into crazy madness and barbaric nonsense. Even those initial stumbling blocks I could have gotten past, but Disney decided to interject their woke garbage into this movie like many other new shows which has now put them on a blacklist for so many others like me. Not sure I would ever pay or even 'watch for free' anything by this company again, but that is me. I have standards, and clearly Disney is determined to brainwash their viewers with woke trash. So (for me) this movie doesn't move the needle, in fact I consider it a waste of my time. 🧻🚽🪠🚫🤮","created_at":"2022-07-14T17:09:25.916Z","id":"62d04dc56d9fe809442a19cc","updated_at":"2022-07-14T17:09:25.916Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62d04dc56d9fe809442a19cc"},{"author":"ValyaKlaiven","author_details":{"name":"","username":"ValyaKlaiven","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16432ec7e57c5757254cf011b7818d21.jpg","rating":null},"content":"> Goog film for everyone","created_at":"2022-07-15T07:36:44.791Z","id":"62d1190c35811d0051dd79f6","updated_at":"2022-07-15T15:21:29.239Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62d1190c35811d0051dd79f6"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**Pretty good but filled with missed opportunities.**\r\n\r\nA Marvel movie so different than the rest... while still just like the rest.

I enjoyed Raimi's horror influences on the MCU. Unfortunately, the movie propelled itself from start to finish at breakneck speed, preventing the story from really taking advantage of the exciting cameos and roster of characters. The pace also jumped past true character motivations making the average audience confused and unsympathetic towards a formerly well-accepted hero now turned villain.","created_at":"2022-08-20T00:23:43.314Z","id":"6300298f3af929008257e428","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:20:03.784Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6300298f3af929008257e428"},{"author":"[robbie grawey]","author_details":{"name":"[robbie grawey]","username":"robbiegrawey","avatar_path":"/qB7lELWBr2iNbKu3eYBI2bxzJ7I.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"Cool!\r\n\r\nWish it had a bit more finesse in it he way it handles its themes and structure, but I had a lot of fun.

So of course I was worried that Marvel being Marvel would screw this one up with their usual woke nonsense or just a substandard Hollywood writer hack script as they too often have done.\r\n\r\nFortunately that was not the case. I quite liked this one.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a CGI special effects feast of course. That is really one of the main reasons to watch this movie. However, Benedict Cumberbatch is really great as Doctor Strange as well.\r\n\r\nThe movie has a half decent story. As good as you could expect from a Marvel movie. As usual it is a mix of action, suspense and comedy relief and Marvel has actually managed to get a decent balance in this movie. Doctor Strange stays competent throughout the movie and although Wong is sometimes a bit silly it is not too bad. There is little of the unintelligent slapstick “comedy” that Marvel sometimes pollute their movies with.\r\n\r\nI have to say that the main bad guy, Wanda the Scarlet Witch, was a bit mediocre though. Sure, when she let loose with her magic it was generally cool but, to me, she lacked real bad guy charisma.\r\n\r\nAt times the movie became a rather violent actually. Although there was no real gore in it, the way Wanda disposed of some of the heroes in the alternate universe was somewhat brutal. Also the alternate universe undead Doctor Strange was almost horror movie material.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line, for me, is that overall this was a very good movie.","created_at":"2022-11-03T08:14:19.888Z","id":"6363785bd75bd6007e7212f5","updated_at":"2022-11-03T08:14:19.990Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6363785bd75bd6007e7212f5"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":13},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1560295,"title":"Doctor

Allow me to disagree (almost) entirely. _Black Panther_ is a great film, not because it breaks the mould, but because Marvel Studios has a successful pattern and _Black Panther_ adheres to it completely. Obviously the importance of a lead who is not just black but actually African is not to be understated, we have the least white cast of any superhero movie to date and they absolutely killed it, all very important socio-political stuff, to be sure. But the bones of _Black Panther_, the plot, the script, the events, the turns, all of that, it's a carbon copy of what's worked 17 times before. It works again, don't get me wrong, _Black Panther_ truly was an experience, both important and fantastic, but to say it re-invented the wheel here, is, to me, an outright lie.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it.

Not only is the lead actor great as T'Challa/Black Panther, but the supporting cast does a fine job as well, especially the female actors. T'Challa is surrounded by smart, strong women. Marvel seems to break its villain curse with Klau and especially Killmonger. Killmonger is very well developed and even sympathetic at times, despite his villainy. He sort of reminded me of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. The action scenes and special effects are outstanding. Highly recommended if you enjoy comic book movies.","created_at":"2018-02-17T20:46:50.715Z","id":"5a8894ba0e0a2653db05d34f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:05.512Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5a8894ba0e0a2653db05d34f"},{"author":"Crenor","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Crenor","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94e0c8200321e724b8a87961c7194804.jpg","rating":null},"content":"Really good movie.

I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.\r\n\r\nI actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less…well…stupid!\r\n\r\nPersonally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.\r\n\r\nOn the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects.","created_at":"2018-02-26T07:03:39.064Z","id":"5a93b14b0e0a2616c602de5e","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:06.231Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5a93b14b0e0a2616c602de5e"},{"author":"OblateSphereDroid","author_details":{"name":"","username":"OblateSphereDroid","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"I was really surprised how much I liked this movie.  There was so much going on; immigration concerns; the fight between saving the world and protecting your own country(sound familiar); the fear of an African country’s resources being pillaged; how best to handle the problems black people face worldwide; and many great authentic feeling cultural nods.  All this while not being heavy or preachy.  You can definitely eat popcorn to this.  The villain; Killmonger, is great.  Not great in that he is scary, though he is, but because he is more complex than some shadowy figure you should just trust is a bad guy because of visual effects or dramatic music.  \r\n\r\nThis movie isn’t just explosions and one-liners in an exotic location.  This is a great movie in general.  It’s always interesting.  There are great relationships between all the characters.  Finally; Wakanda is really a place.  It feels alive and lived in; not just impressive buildings used as a backdrop.  They did a wonderful job of worldbuilding; from the rituals, to the clothing, fancy tech, and scenery.  This movie is definitely worth a watch. \r\n\r\n☆☆☆☆-1/2\r\n\r\nI also have to add that; you get to actually see Andy Serkis!

First, the good.\r\n\r\nThe action is fun, the emotions hit home, and the story isn't dirt-poor. \r\n\r\nWhile the CGI gets ripped on from time to time, I thought it was solid enough for a Marvel movie. The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one. It was reminiscent of a James Bond movie. \r\n\r\nIn fact, that's another appeal, at least to me. The secret technology base and the fun action scenes were a great callback to James Bond-type movies. I do think the movie would have been complemented by giving T'Challa a similar vice as Bond's, although Marvel probably wouldn't veer down that line for the seemingly morally absolute King of Wakanda.\r\n\r\nThe story, well, it's a mixed bag. Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie. \r\n\r\nThis is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one. Wakanda has a ton of wonderful mythology, but almost none of it is explained. The movie never really explains how the Wakandans used vibranium was used to make themselves wealthy. It touches on it in some exposition, but there was much more that was just glossed over. \r\n\r\nIn addition, W'Kabi became radicalized by Killmonger much too quickly for such a pivotal relationship to flip. Some of the emotional aspects of the movie fell flat because they weren't given enough screen time. \r\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Black Panther is a fun movie that adds to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It should have been two movies, but I doubt this is the last we'll see of Wakanda.","created_at":"2018-05-07T20:29:04.388Z","id":"5af0b71092514119a6000099","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:08.418Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5af0b71092514119a6000099"},{"author":"DanDare","author_details":{"name":"","username":"DanDare","avatar_path":"/gY0Mjm4thleETxdESQPabdn5CB3.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"The character of T'Challa made his debut in Captain America 3: Civil War.\r\n\r\nIn Black Panther, T'Challa returns to his homeland of Wakanda after the death of his father who has been hiding a secret about his brother who lived in the USA.

The kingdom is technologically advanced due to its secret resource Vibranium, a priceless, almost magical metal. Unfortunately, T’Challa’s reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik “Killmonger” (Michael B. Jordan).\r\n\r\nWith its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), “Black Panther” was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called “racist” by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie’s likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn’t all that involving. It’s basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even “Ant-Man” (2015).\r\n\r\nStill, it’s respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there’s some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a “colonizer,” which isn’t even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.\r\n\r\nThe waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic’s story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the \"Panther's Rage\" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. \r\n\r\nAnd it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T’Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It’s a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W’Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn’t acknowledged in this movie; shameful.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguazú Waterfalls, Argentina. Ironically, nothing was shot in Africa. WRITERS: Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (and, uncredited, Don McGregor).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-","created_at":"2018-06-12T21:24:08.105Z","id":"5b2039f8c3a36814900052f3","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:09.493Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b2039f8c3a36814900052f3"},{"author":"trinistud1","author_details":{"name":"","username":"trinistud1","avatar_path":null,"rating":10.0},"content":"Awesome movie","created_at":"2018-08-24T18:20:18.509Z","id":"5b804c62c3a3687e19012e25","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:11.649Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5b804c62c3a3687e19012e25"},{"author":"moovies","author_details":{"name":"","username":"moovies","avatar_path":"/1aF4vxy9sdOP1Mdl6gWGlIOdy6V.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"\"Black Panther is Marvelous (pun intended)\"\r\n\r\nT’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to his native Wakanda to be crowned king. Not long after he’s challenged for the throne and war looms over his homeland.\r\n\r\nBlack Panther isn’t your typical hero because let’s face it… He’s black. And apart from Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smeagol (Andy Serkis), everybody’s black. And that’s the way it should be.\r\nThe entire cast delivers. Boseman is excellent as king T’Challa who struggles with his new role. It doesn’t get any easierr when Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) shows up. Killmonger is a mean SOB yet you care for him (some good writing right there). He’s a worthy adversary and one of the better Marvel villains. Jordan portrays him perfectly. Director Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan are a match made in heaven. This is their third collaboration after ‘Fruitvale Station’ and ‘Creed’ and again they’re successful. The movie itself gets better as Jordan’s role gets bigger.\r\n\r\nThe female characters and actors are equally impressive. Especially Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) and Okoye (Danai Gurira) steal the show.\r\n\r\nThere’s less humour in ‘Black Panther’ than we’re used to seeing in Marvel films but that’s not a bad thing. The movie doesn’t need it.\r\n\r\nThough it’s set in (fictional) Africa there wasn’t any filming done in Africa. Nonetheless the movie looks right. The makers did a great job of creating Wakanda. Huge props to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and composer Ludwig Göransson who help bring Wakanda to life.\r\nOn the downside there’s a lot of CGI. Sometimes it’s too obvious (rhinos say hi). Despite that the battle scenes are beautifully choreographed. Especially Okoye wielding her spear is a thing to behold.\r\n\r\nAll in all ‘Black Panther’ is another wonderful addition to the MCU and we can’t wait to see what role T’Challa and his sidekicks are going to play in ‘Avengers: Infinity War’.","created_at":"2018-11-23T20:14:17.664Z","id":"5bf85f999251415cc80f0b3e","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:14.562Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5bf85f999251415cc80f0b3e"},{"author":"tmdb44006625","author_details":{"name":"","username":"tmdb44006625","avatar_path":null,"rating":7.0},"content":"Black Panther will probably be remembered as a culturally significant film more so than a great one, but that shouldn't take away from the movie's deeper theme of inclusivity.

I really like the world building of Wakanda, as well as the cinematography and costume design. The cast are, as expected, excellent as well.\r\n\r\nChadwick Boseman is terrific as T'Challa, as I knew he would be based on the glimpse we see of him in 2016's <em>'Captain America: Civil War'</em>. He is the best actor here, but Danai Gurira runs him close. I'm a huge fan of Gurira's due to her performances in <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> so knew I'd rate her here too, she's fun to watch - it's cool to see her weapon-wielding once again.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Lupita Nyong'o is good and so is Letitia Wright; she's great in 2015's <em>'Urban Hymn'</em>, which I had seen her in previously. It's a fairly stacked cast, with the likes of Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis, Daniel Kaluuya and Michael B. Jordan also appearing; Jordan's character isn't the best, but he himself is more than solid.","created_at":"2021-01-22T22:30:15.886Z","id":"600b51f7cc277c003f1425ea","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:50.513Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/600b51f7cc277c003f1425ea"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"This is quite a tough film to review objectively; at times it is as good as any from the comic-book universe; the cinematography and effects are top drawer and the pace of the action is usually well judged and enjoyable. The writing and the acting, on the other hand, are a different matter. Chadwick Boseman as \"T'Challa\" is about as wooden as they come as he returns to rule his outwardly agrarian African nation (\"Wakanda\") that secretly has some state-of-the art kit based around a rare, but enormously powerful mineral from outer space. In this particular outing he isn't much helped by Martin Freeman (\"Agent Ross\") or Forest Whitaker as the sagely \"Zuri\". Letitia Wright injects some charm as his tech-savvy little sister \"Shuri\" and for a bit at the beginning, Andy Serkis hams up nicely as South African arch villain \"Ulysses Klaue\" (pronounced claw) but once it settles down, it becomes a beautifully shot but rather bland, simplistic right vs wrong, do the right thing type of story. I do like Michael B. Jordan (\"Erik\") - here he has a screen presence that is charming, cheeky and he knows how to work an audience - and I have to say I was on his side pretty much from the outset, but sadly though, the ending is never in doubt and with neither suspense nor jeopardy to sustain it's initial promise, \"Black Panther\" just ends up being a great looking, but pretty shallow festival of colour and CGI.","created_at":"2022-11-11T06:31:28.093Z","id":"636dec40f14dad008399e519","updated_at":"2022-11-11T06:31:28.212Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/636dec40f14dad008399e519"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":17},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":153257,"title":"Black Panther","original_title":"Black Panther","plot_overview":"King T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to serve as his country's new leader.

saw the first one, nor played any of the games - but I still quite enjoyed this animated adventure. \"Sonic\" is determined to use his powers to be a crime fighting hero, but frequently causes more havoc than the criminals! When the dastardly \"Robotnik\" manages to escape from his prison in a galaxy far, far, way and returns with the echidna from hell (\"Knuckles\") though, our blue pal finds himself and his family in considerable peril. Luckily, help is on hand from the twin-tailed \"Tails\" and battle lines are drawn Who can find the giant emerald first? The story is pretty derivative - bits of \"Indiana Jones\"; \"National Treasure\" and even \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" all seem to have influenced the story, which I have to say is a little predictably thin. That said, it is well placed with plenty in the script for the grown ups amongst the audience. \"Sonic\" makes for quite a likeable rodent and Jim Carrey\"s engagingly hammy, moustachioed, megalomanic works well. The star? Well that's Natasha Rothwell's no-nonsense, would-be bride \"Rachel\" (a part of the storyline that doesn't work so well, but she is definitely not to be messed with). The visual effects are impressive and though maybe fifteen minutes too long, I still found it very much better than I had expected.","created_at":"2022-04-04T09:35:30.915Z","id":"624abbe2d9f4a60063674455","updated_at":"2022-04-04T09:35:30.915Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/624abbe2d9f4a60063674455"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a vastly superior sequel to the first adaptation.\r\n\r\nJeff Fowler works with his screenwriting team to fix some of the issues with the original flick, successfully managing to create a much less corporate work, more focused on Sonic and, this time, also Tails and Knuckles, in addition to putting humans aside in a subplot that, even so, still bothered more than it should.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of phenomenal voice acting from the cast, as well as an already iconic performance by Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, entertainment levels soar tremendously as the action-adventure sequences amaze viewers with praiseworthy animation and visual effects, as well as an engaging main narrative that expands on the origin of the hedgehogs while simultaneously developing the same characters.\r\n\r\nFun for kids and adults alike.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2022-04-04T21:25:34.903Z","id":"624b624ed399e600660e2b53","updated_at":"2022-04-04T21:25:34.903Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/624b624ed399e600660e2b53"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Sonic the Hedgehog 2 embraces the nostalgia of Sega Genesis and the essence of the 90s with a film that is fun for absolutely everyone of all ages.

Doctor Robotnik (Jim Carrey) was banished from Earth by Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and crash-landed his spaceship on the Mushroom Planet. His only means of escape is Sonic’s quill, which is flowing with immense energy, and he uses it to send out a distress signal. This catches the attention of Knuckles (Idris Elba), another super-powerful anthropomorphic animal like Sonic. Knuckles is the last living member of the echidna tribe that was wiped out in the same war that sent Sonic to Earth many years ago.","created_at":"2022-06-20T18:18:56.278Z","id":"62b0ba10f1b5710051fc3aa7","updated_at":"2022-07-15T14:42:52.129Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62b0ba10f1b5710051fc3aa7"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"The third time is the charm or, after having been less than thrilled about the last two movies I have watched this one was finally one that I quite enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWhen I watched the first Sonic movie with the kids I was quite amused by it. This one I also watched with the kids and I have to say it was some fun two hours.\r\n\r\nThese movies are pure comedies with an aspect of adventure. Make no mistake about, they are silly movies. Then, with Jim Carrey in one of the lead roles that is what anyone that has not lived under a rock in Coyote land would expect.\r\n\r\nJim Carrey more often than not grates on me with his overacting and ridiculous behavior but in this movie he is the perfect fit.\r\n\r\nThe movie sets the tone right away when it starts at the mushroom planet, or as Jim Carrey (Dr Robotnik) calls it, the piece of shitake planet, with Dr Robotnik’s coffee making machinery.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is one long ride of, mostly, slapstick jokes but still following the red thread of the story. A story which is not really bad and which adds a nice adventure aspect to the movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie even adds some realism, although they probably did not realize that during production, in that the federal agents are just as big a–holes as they have proven themselves to be in real life lately.\r\n\r\nThe grand finale with Dr Robotnik’s huge robot was quite hilarious. I really do not want to spoil things but watch out for that moustache. I’m happy that they refrained from following up that snot laser with a fart laser though.\r\n\r\nBottom line, a really fun family adventure movie.","created_at":"2022-08-14T13:42:32.367Z","id":"62f8fbc825882300821ffd06","updated_at":"2022-08-14T13:42:32.490Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62f8fbc825882300821ffd06"},{"author":"[robbie grawey]","author_details":{"name":"[robbie grawey]","username":"robbiegrawey","avatar_path":"/qB7lELWBr2iNbKu3eYBI2bxzJ7I.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Lol, I can't believe these movies are being made.

In the nick of time too, as the planet is soon toast! Spin on and a few years later the boy is now doing his best Henry Cavill impersonations as \"Superman\" aided and abetted by his equally super-strong pooch \"Krypto\". It turns out that these are just two of a plethora of heroes from the \"Justice League\" who try to keep the evil \"Lex Luthor\" from achieving world domination. What nobody expects here though, is that a meteor that \"Luthor\" had hoped would give him the power to finally defeat his nemesis ends up in the hands of a loved-up guinea pig (\"Lulu\") - and a clever and scheming guinea pig at that. She rather adeptly uses her new-found powers to embolden an army of other, now ninja, guinea pigs to capture and imprison the \"Justice League\" so she can get prove her worth to the love of her life - the ruthless \"Luthor\". There is a glimmer of hope! The meteorite that enhanced the rodents has also fallen the way of a few others, and together with \"Krypto\" they band together, learn to harness their powers and the scene is set for a final showdown. The animation is perfectly adequate, but the story is weak and far too thinly strung out. The turtle has a few quite witty lines of dialogue but the rest of it mixes cheese and sentiment in an almost cringe-making fashion. There are far too many characters and by the end it has a sort of chaotic \"Avengers Endgame\" (2019) scenario that was as devoid of jeopardy as it was dull and repetitive to watch. At times, indeed, it was almost as if DC wanted to make a film to remind us that not all super-heroes were developed by Marvel. Maybe I am just too old - but I struggled to stay the course with this.","created_at":"2022-07-31T20:26:24.097Z","id":"62e6e5709f51af00624df294","updated_at":"2022-07-31T20:34:41.572Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62e6e5709f51af00624df294"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1561438,"title":"DC

With each entry in this trilogy, the movies get farther and farther away from what Halloween is. With Ends there is no tension and no horror, there are some good kills but with nothing building up to it they felt stale. This movie also tears down Michael Meyers in a way that felt out of place in the trilogy. Halloween Kills built Michael up to be an indestructible force with the ability to withstand fire or multiple gunshot wounds, but in Ends that is flipped on its head making him weak due to the ending of the predecessor. It left me feeling like the writers had no idea what they were doing in developing this trilogy. The marketing of the movie was a total farce as well. It was building up to a final clash between Laurie and Michael, and while that does happen the majority follows a character that was just introduced (Corey Cunningham). Even though I really like the opening sequence and backstory to Corey, it had no place being centerstage in the final installment. Overall, this movie was slightly better than the sequel but still squanders the potential that Halloween (2018) had for the trilogy. If any more movies or trilogies are made in the future, please for the love of God hire a producer/writer to develop the entire series instead of piecing it together film by film.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _44%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Poor_","created_at":"2022-10-14T18:10:26.609Z","id":"6349a612b7abb50081e7f296","updated_at":"2022-10-14T18:10:26.679Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6349a612b7abb50081e7f296"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"**Poor writing and a confusing story overshadowed a few shining moments and satisfying conclusions to character stories.**\r\n\r\nIt’s so hard to choose whether I liked or disliked Halloween Ends. I enjoyed the resolution to Laurie Strode’s 40-year story arc and the hopeful journey for her granddaughter, Allyson. Even the final showdown between Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers was satisfying, although the story didn’t build to the climax well. Sadly that is where the pros stop. The story was a convoluted mess that ignored all the build-up of the first two films and focused on a new character that didn’t matter to the overall story and didn’t have much impact on the film. As a result, Halloween Ends forgot what made its two predecessors successful and told a pointless meandering tale that had its moments but ultimately disappointed.","created_at":"2022-10-15T17:27:31.975Z","id":"634aed83c8a2d4007a2fdaee","updated_at":"2022-10-15T17:27:32.060Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/634aed83c8a2d4007a2fdaee"},{"author":"MovieGuys","author_details":{"name":"","username":"MovieGuys","avatar_path":null,"rating":4.0},"content":"An unfortunate end, to a horror franchise, that started way back in 1978. \r\n\r\nHalloween Ends, is an inarticulate mess, that fails to build on past films.

Otherwise, this is just one \"Halloween\" movie too many and it's only scream yells \"put me out of my misery\" pretty much from the start of this slow and plodding denouement to the franchise. Rohan Campbell (\"Corey\") is bullied by some kids who end up shoving him from a bridge. He is dragged into the storm drains by you know who and emerges a man possessed. He has also attached himself to \"Allyson\" (Andi Matichak) who just happens to be the daughter of long suffering \"Laurie\" (Jamie Lee Curtis) and after a bit of hysteric family melodrama, all of her demons are flee-flowing and we are heading, slowly and ponderously to a conclusion that the best of which has already been seen many times in the trailers. This is far too long, virtually nothing happens until the last fifteen minutes and even then, there isn't even the vaguest hint of menace or jeopardy. The production is adequate, but JLC doesn't really feature often enough - as in \"Halloween Kills\" (2021) to make much impact - and the whole thing is episodic and smacks of made for television.

digital animation geniuses at Pixar are back with “Turning Red” and it marks a departure for the studio known for the “Toy Story” and “Cars”, franchises.\r\n\r\nSet in 1990s Toronto, the film centers around 8th grader Mei (Rosalie Chiang), who considers herself an adult at 13 and eagerly applies herself to school when she is not helping her family tour business at a local Temple or hanging with her friends.\r\n\r\nLife comes crashing to a halt when after a traumatic day of embarrassment; Mei awakens in the form of a large Red Panda. In a panic, Mei attempts to hide her situation which causes her over-protective mother to assume it is Puberty related and that her hormones are kicking in.\r\n\r\nMei desperately wants to get her life back to normal and learns that as long as she is calm her Panda is under control. However, this proves to be harder than expected and soon Mei learns that the Panda is the result of a family bloodline but there is a way to end it during a Lunar ceremony in a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nChaos soon follows as Mei struggles with her situation and must find a way to cope with the changes that are going on and make some very important decisions about her life and her future.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review for me as never having been a teenage girl dealing with puberty, raging estrogen, and the issues that go with it.  That being said the film struggles to find a balance as it tacks on the capers of Mei in Panda form without being overly funny or charming and keeps the focus on Teen Angst, puberty-related issues and becoming an adult.\r\n\r\nThe film lacks the interesting characters, charm, and appeal that have set the foundation for so many Pixar films and it is surprising that a company that can elicit a range of emotions in an animated short fail to really connect with their latest feature. There were some amusing parts but the film as a whole was rather dull and lacked much in the way of humor and was very predictable.\r\n\r\nThe decision to put the film directly on Disney+ as the studio’s recent “Soul” and “Luca” was raised some controversy but in the end, I do believe it was the right decision as “Turning Red” is not likely to be a film that draws people to the cinema beyond the opening weekend.\r\n\r\nIt is a film that is a bold step for the company, but one that lacks the charm and humor of previous films as not everyone is going to want to sit through a feature-length film on teenage angst and dealing with changing bodies and the emotional turmoil that follows.  However, the target audience is likely to connect with the characters and it will be interesting to see what the reaction to the film is long-term.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5\r\n\r\n“Turning Red” will debut on Disney+ on March 11th","created_at":"2022-03-07T14:06:46.684Z","id":"62261176c995ee006eb61b4d","updated_at":"2022-03-07T14:06:46.684Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62261176c995ee006eb61b4d"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/turning-red-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Turning Red is undoubtedly the riskiest, possibly the most divisive work in Pixar history. Without any remorse or restraint, Domee Shi and Julia Cho unapologetically approach the sensitive topic of (female) puberty in a quite shocking, positively impactful manner.\r\n\r\nA narrative that unquestionably explores the hormonal, emotional, and sexual developments of its characters, conveying a message of self-acceptance and understanding of human evolution through its metaphors loaded with youthful excitement.\r\n\r\nWith the well-known technical attributes from the successful studio, this film will serve as an essential companion for all pre-teens who will deal with or are going through this inevitable and \"inconvenient\" phase of life.\r\n\r\nOne of the best movies of the year until this day.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2022-03-07T15:31:08.470Z","id":"6226253c1b7c590042aaeb53","updated_at":"2022-03-07T15:31:08.470Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6226253c1b7c590042aaeb53"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Well worth a watch, this.\r\n\r\n<em>'Turning Red'</em> is a very good flick from Disney/Pixar. It's different in a way, I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out based on the first few minutes but by the end it provides the required and expected amount of entertainment and meaning.\r\n\r\nThe voice cast are excellent, I have no faults with them. Rosalie Chiang gives a performance full of energy in the lead role, while Sandra Oh puts in a strong display alongside Chiang. The rest of them are good too, as I also recognised James Hong and Lori Tan Chinn. Us UK viewers also have the bonus of a small role for Anne-Marie.","created_at":"2022-03-11T14:44:50.977Z","id":"622b6062498ef9001a41b169","updated_at":"2022-03-11T14:44:50.977Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/622b6062498ef9001a41b169"},{"author":"Daks88","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Daks88","avatar_path":null,"rating":5.0},"content":"Kinda boring","created_at":"2022-03-20T00:50:02.378Z","id":"62367a3a53866e007e2e81af","updated_at":"2022-03-28T19:25:32.766Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62367a3a53866e007e2e81af"},{"author":"SpotaMovie.com","author_details":{"name":"SpotaMovie.com","username":"bastag","avatar_path":"/h9FkucYmSN3YH5OmrNRWO5rdquS.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"Full Analysis at Spotamovie.com - **Intro** - Pixar’s movies usually have great insights, and even with Turning Red, they provided us with meaningful messages to help our children and us grow our personalities and mindset. - **The Story** - Meilin is an energetic teenager ready to walk into the grown-up world.

It soon turns out that these transformation skills run in the family, and huge great angry pandas are not to be messed with. The animation is fine and Eilish/O'Connell have written some fitting, if hardly their most memorable, numbers, but it is just too long and the theme recycles itself once too often for my old eyes.

Idris Elba (\"Nate\") arrives with his daughters \"Mer\" (Iyana Halley) and \"Norah\" (Leah Jeffries) at at remote African game reserve run by his friend \"Martin\" (Sharlto Copley). Pretty soon we realise that the luggage they brought on the plane is but the tip of the iceberg of baggage that actually accompanied this family and we are quickly immersed in a rather unattractive melodrama surrounding his late wife who tragically passed away (hopefully before seeing this film). Anyway, they are out on a guided tour when they discover that all is not well - an huge rogue lion is out to avenge himself on humanity after a group of poachers annihilated his pride. Snacking with impunity, this lion is soon determined to make a meal of these travellers - but can they stay alive long enough for help to arrive? Elba struggles to deliver consistency with his rather un-necessary American accent, the two girls are frankly just annoying and from very early on, I was wholeheartedly on the side of the lion. Curiously (or fortunately for the narrative), this great beast has virtually no sense of smell so \"Nate\" and his offspring seem to manage to dice with death on an implausibly regular basis. Taking shelter in an old school - leaving all the doors open for added protection; getting in and out of their land cruiser with scant regard for their safety and armed with little more than a pen-knife. The dialogue is OK - that's because it says it over and over again... \"Are you OK?\" \"Are You OK\"? The last few scenes are just plain silly - indeed, they reminded me of my schoolboy enjoyment of \"Daktari\" (1966) with the friendly \"Clarence the cross-eyed lion\" married together with one of the those semi-educational Disney films with actuality interspersed into the fiction. It does have the benefit of being short - just the ninety minutes, but what action there is is all too often drowned out in the banal family drama that is just dull. Nobody's finest work, sorry...","created_at":"2022-08-27T21:55:21.506Z","id":"630a92c9b7d3520080a5b9b7","updated_at":"2022-08-27T21:58:46.816Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630a92c9b7d3520080a5b9b7"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"MORE SPOILER-FREE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/\r\n\r\n\"Beast is one of the most gorgeous, satisfying films of the year.

The pointless family drama, weak dialogue, and far-fetched man versus lion battles prevented Beast from being as enjoyable as movies like Crawl or Deep Blue Sea.","created_at":"2022-09-09T04:58:08.777Z","id":"631ac7e05c5cc8007d19b1f1","updated_at":"2022-09-09T04:58:08.829Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/631ac7e05c5cc8007d19b1f1"},{"author":"JPRetana","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPRetana","avatar_path":"/eYudFTVvIpCweDVQEl878whalTy.jpg","rating":1.0},"content":"I think the key to figuring out this movie is an early scene in which one of the characters is wearing a Jurassic Park shirt. This must be the filmmakers winking their eye at the audience, letting us know that what we’re about to see is all in jest. \r\n\r\nHow else to explain a film where the protagonists arrive in South Africa and immediately start bitching about the heat, but they’re all wearing jackets, and sweaters, and hoodies? More importantly, how are we to interpret a movie that introduces the issues of poaching (people who kill lions) and anti-poaching (people who kill people who kill lions, or at least that’s what Beast thinks it is), only to have the antagonist be a maneater (a lion that kills people regardless of their stance on poaching).\r\n\r\nThis only perpetuates the myth that lions have never met a human they didn’t want to maul (while contributing nothing to the poaching debate). I’m not saying lions follow an animal version of the First Law of Robotics, but they do get a bad rap in the movies, as do sharks — and in that sense, Beast is closer to Jaws: The Revenge than Jaws. Actually, Beast is even worse than Jaws: The Revenge because the latter at least used a mechanical shark, as opposed to the former’s pitiful CGI lion. \r\n\r\nAll things considered, this is a film that makes you yearn for the simplicity of The Ghost and the Darkness, which made no pretense of being anything other than a Hemingway-lite story about male bonding over hunting big game (and which, though taking many liberties with the source material, had the decency to feature real lions). \r\n\r\nHere, however, the hero tricks two other lions into killing the 'evil' lion, not only a gambit that could easily backfire, but also not very nature-friendly. Although coming to think about it, maybe these lions do comply with the second part of the First Law (\"A robot [or in this case, lion] may not ... through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm\").","created_at":"2022-09-13T21:10:02.320Z","id":"6320f1aa06f984007f66317b","updated_at":"2022-09-13T21:10:02.430Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6320f1aa06f984007f66317b"},{"author":"thecrustycurmudgeon","author_details":{"name":"","username":"thecrustycurmudgeon","avatar_path":"/jTMXAir80rmBrjfqsQmPjLP72JV.jpg","rating":2.0},"content":"**o.m.g - one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Please don't pay to see this film!**\r\n\r\nIdris Elba is generally mediocre anyway, but he can put on an acceptable performance with a decent script and concept. Sadly, neither was available to him in this bumbling, tragic, and failed effort to create dramatic cinema. \r\n\r\nI'm amazed that anyone could create a movie based on such a predictable and often used concept and do it so badly. One poorly contrived scene after another, belief is not just suspended, but abandoned entirely to piece together a cartoonish presentation of sappy ideas and bad cgi. The script is equally dreary, simplistic, and filled with mostly predictable chatter, until it suddenly leaps off the cliff of reality and into the void of astoundingly stupid. Sadly, that happens far too often.\r\n\r\nDon't bother going to the cinema to see this. Wait a few weeks for it to get relegated to Pluto TV, Amazon Prime Video,  or Freevee. Honestly, it won't take long.","created_at":"2022-09-23T07:07:57.434Z","id":"632d5b4d55937b0084f84017","updated_at":"2022-09-28T17:36:20.841Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/632d5b4d55937b0084f84017"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"_Beast_ had its moments where I was left gripping the arms of my chair at the edge of my seat, but the majority of film had me verbally laughing at the poor character writing. This movie does a lot right, don't get me wrong. The buildup to the encounter was done really well. You get a great introduction to all the characters and the individual struggles they go through due to the loss of Dr. Nate Daniels wife; it gives a baseline for the viewer to be able to relate and sympathize with the character. The action is pretty decent, and I was really impressed with the CGI work done on the lion. But, once the climax ensues the writing goes downhill, mainly in terms of character decision making. I found that the writers did not really know how to create unique situations to put the characters in with the lion, resulting in baffling decision to prolong the duration of the film. At every turn, a solution is so easily in view, but they do something that is such a right turn that it is unbelievable. The performance of Idris Alba really pulls the score up though. He does a fantastic job and portrays the loving and protecting nature of a father so well. I enjoyed his cool calm collected nature during high pressure scenes, it gave a sense of reality to him being a doctor. Overall, this film is not great, but it was entertaining, and I had a good time.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _65%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Decent_","created_at":"2022-10-14T17:51:49.875Z","id":"6349a1b5501cf2007f6ec236","updated_at":"2022-10-14T17:51:49.948Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6349a1b5501cf2007f6ec236"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":6}},{"id":1620890,"title":"Beast","original_title":"Beast","plot_overview":"A recently widowed man and his two teenage daughters travel to a game reserve in South Africa.

Batman” Is A Very Engaging And Unforgettable Tale That Is One Of The Best Adaptations Of The Character Ever\r\n\r\nIn 1989 Michael Keaton was seen as a very controversial choice to wear the Cowl of Batman but soon proved his doubters wrong by turning “Batman” and its subsequent sequel “Batman Returns” into massive Box Office success before leaving the cape behind.\r\n\r\nWhile four other actors have taken up the cinematic version of the character in the subsequent years, Keaton has remained for many the Gold Standard with Christian Bale likely being his biggest rival.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert Pattinson was named as the new Batman, there was interest but concern as an actor who is largely known for playing Edward in the “Twilight” films seemed to be an odd choice. However, I would say that anyone who has seen some of his recent work including his performance in “The Lighthouse” would be playing him a disservice by saying he was not up to the part.\r\n\r\nIn “The Batman”, audiences are given a darker and more broken Bruce Wayne, an Emo recluse who is far from the Socialite he has been portrayed as for decades and a very sullen and withdrawn individual who does not exude charm or grace and even shows issues making eye-contact.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mayor of Gotham is killed shortly before the election by a mysterious individual known as “The Riddler” (Paul Dano), the vigilante known as “The Batman” is called in to help the police by Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright).  Gordon has been working with Batman for some time but it is clear that his association with him has not won him any favors with his fellow officers, many of which openly question his use and involvement in the crime scenes.\r\n\r\nFurther complicating matters are clues left at the various crime locales that are addressed to The Batman and cause many to believe that he may be working with the very killer they are attempting to stop.\r\n\r\nAs the investigation unfolds, the seedy side of Gotham City comes to light in the form of a missing girl who was photographed with the married Mayor and may well be the key to the investigation. Her disappearance leads her friend Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), to take on her Catwoman persona and delve deep into an underworld that features deadly individuals ranging from Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and The Penguin (Colin Farrell), amongst others as she and the Batman conduct their own investigations that at times overlap and further complicate matters.\r\n\r\nAs the body count rises and Batman races to find the true method behind the madness of The Riddler, the tone becomes darker and more sinister in a deadly race against time.\r\n\r\nThe film eschews the usual abundance of action sequences and glossy special effects which are common for Comic Book related films and instead gives audiences a slow-burning murder mystery that holds your attention from start to finish over its three-hour run time.\r\n\r\nThe dark and foreboding tone of the film is brought home by the haunting and sharp piano keys of the film’s theme that permeates the film and punches home that this is a film clearly aimed at a more adult audience.\r\n\r\nPattinson does a great job showing the deeply broken individual that is behind the mask and that Batman is the only form of escape or therapy that Bruce Wayne has due to his insistence on saving a city that many argue cannot be saved. He has strained his relationship at times with Alfred (Andy Serkis), caused damage to the financial stability and reputation of the family company in his quest for vengeance and justice, and has become a bitter and broken recluse in doing so. In many ways, it could be argued that his only socialization with others is as The Batman and his single-minded obsession is chilling to watch.\r\n\r\nPattinson also handles the action sequences well as the film spaces them out to put the emphasis more on the man than the gadgets as they are kept to a minimum even during a thrilling chase with the new version of The Batmobile.\r\n\r\nThe strong supporting cast works well with the film and Paul Dano gives a very compelling and disturbing version of his character which makes the film even darker and more engrossing.\r\n\r\nDirector Matt Reeves has crafted a dark and foreboding tone and visual style as a good portion of the film takes place in the darkness and his screenplay is not afraid to take chances by putting the emphasis on the characters and their flaws versus an abundance of action and effects.\r\n\r\nI found this version of the character and interpretation more engrossing than prior versions of the film as the bold move to do a slow-burning and dark murder mystery versus an effect-laden action film reminded me of some of the better Batman stories such as Batman: The Killing Joke or Batman: The Long Halloween.\r\n\r\nThe film is not going to be for everyone, especially younger viewers and some may take issue with the casting choices, but their performances shine and as such, “The Batman” was a very engaging and unforgettable tale that for me serves as one of the best adaptations of the character ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2022-02-28T17:12:37.932Z","id":"621d02856b5fc2006b954bab","updated_at":"2022-02-28T17:12:37.932Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/621d02856b5fc2006b954bab"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"The reviews and hype for this movie were massive!

Matt Reeves made some genius creative choices among which were the more reclusive rockstar grungy Bruce Wayne and the Riddler being heavily influenced by the Zodiac.  The acting was fantastic as well with Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano offering some standout performances.  The Batman is driven with psychological and mystery focus as compared to the action comedy style of most superhero movies.  My only complaint is that the mystery felt fairly predictable.

The entire cast is extraordinary, especially Paul Dano and Robert Pattinson - the latter destroys all skepticism around his talent.\r\n\r\nApart from a short period at the end of the second act, the three hours fly by.

The film deserves credit for prominently shining the spotlight on the underbelly of crime in Gotham, but the storytelling in _The Batman_ is a lot like Bugs Bunny meaning to have taken that left turn at Albuquerque; a meandering foray down a dark rabbit hole that isn’t entirely necessary.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Batman-2022-Review-When-is-a-Bat-Not-Quite-a-Bat","created_at":"2022-03-06T01:50:57.237Z","id":"62241381b84f940045446a10","updated_at":"2022-03-06T01:50:57.237Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62241381b84f940045446a10"},{"author":"edwecks","author_details":{"name":"","username":"edwecks","avatar_path":null,"rating":10.0},"content":"Masterpiece.

This is the definitive live-action Batman. An epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of Gotham City.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson perfectly embodies both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I love the character arc he goes through, realizing Gotham doesn't need vengeance to heal, but hope. Zoë Kravitz plays a phenomenal Selina Kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. Another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike The Dark Knight Rises). Paul Dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of The Riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. Andy Serkis plays an excellent Alfred, being Bruce's emotional support during Dark times.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is absolute God-Tier. Elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. Finally a score to rival Danny Elfman's iconic score. Matt Reeves direction is impeccable as always, getting some nice shots while also making it feel nice and claustrophobic around Batman.\r\n\r\nOverall, a God-Tier Batman movie that I can't wait for the Cinematic Universe that's being made around it as I type this.","created_at":"2022-03-15T11:52:17.425Z","id":"62307df10ed2ab0045ed6b4d","updated_at":"2022-03-28T19:27:44.825Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62307df10ed2ab0045ed6b4d"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"It's a cracker, no doubt about it!\r\n\r\nMatt Reeves did a great job with 2022's <em>'The Batman'</em>. It's difficult not to compare this to other Batman films, though that's DC/Warner Bros. fault for featuring him so much in recent times. I'll get this out the way early: I'd say <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/batman-begins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman Begins</a>'</em>/'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-dark-knight/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Dark Knight</a>'</em> are superior, not by much, which is a similar case for the character performances too.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson is a terrific Bruce Wayne, though Christian Bale still edges him out in my eyes. Zoë Kravitz is probably the best Catwoman I've seen, though the rest - from the Riddler to Penguin to Alfred - have been portrayed better; aside from Commissioner Gordon, with Jeffrey Wright being excellent. Paul Dano is the least enjoyable performer, for me, here, I found his showing to be a bit 'meh' - effective, but meh. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo, I won't say as who, but I don't hold high hopes for him in that role; though, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/the-batman-ending-joker-barry-keoghan-matt-reeves-1235196812/#:~:text=While%20it%20may,more%20%E2%80%9CBatman%E2%80%9D%20movies.\" rel=\"nofollow\">apparently</a> it won't be anything that happens anyway. For the best!\r\n\r\nAnyway... the above sounds <em>way</em> too negative - as I did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film, hence the very positive rating. The pacing is very good, the cinematography is brilliant (Gotham looks fantastically bleak!), the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point. The scenes with Pattinson/Kravitz and Pattinson/Wright are my favourite moments. It's a film that I'd consider as 'outstanding'.\r\n\r\nIt'll be cool to see what Reeves does with this trilogy (should it happen, of course).","created_at":"2022-03-18T02:20:51.206Z","id":"6233ec8303bf84001c6cb00d","updated_at":"2022-03-18T02:20:51.206Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6233ec8303bf84001c6cb00d"},{"author":"Tatsky","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Tatsky","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15b623722f19c0fea3949afeba92d4bc.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"I like how Batman is depicted with a naive and loser POV from his rich high tower, a rich trust fund baby called out by both sane (Catwoman) and insane (Riddler) people while he remains oblivious until the consequences are literally flooding the city. While he uses the idea of Batman as a mantle for him to process trauma, his obliviousness to his own celebrity status and image creates unintentional side effects from his parents' death hogging the spotlight away from the people that mattered to his own nebulous idea of \"vengeance\" being co-opted by the goons, a heel-turn realization that eventually changes the rack focus, ultimately leading to a wider perspective and a selfless act of cutting the cord and helping others. Hope is more important than his idea of justice, in the end, empathy being the missing piece throughout. Instead of being a voyeur like Riddler during his master plan (Riddler binoculars on the mayor, Batman binoculars on Catwoman), he switches to being on the ground to help, no longer from his high castle.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting how this arc plays out. At the beginning, it plays into this \"badass\" idea comic book fans love to gloat about Batman of striking fear into crime, but the way it's portrayed is frightening to everyone. It's a better criticism of Batman's fascism than BvS was going for, showcasing his fear to people who don't even deserve it, such as kids doing vandalism who probably believe the system is failing them, but to him at the beginning crime all looks the same.\r\n\r\nHonestly this film goes harder than Phantasm on the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne. They're inseparable by choice, to the point that Bruce basically is Batman even when not in the costume, a social recluse who can barely function in real life, listening to emo music and having rings around his eyes, a night owl to the extreme. The struggle is there even as Batman, literally smashing his face on a truck.\r\n\r\nThere are some contradictions throughout thematically, however. It's weird how it goes between \"it's the WHOLE system, all cops are pigs\" to \"it's just bad apples\" simultaneously, displaying a somewhat cringe centrism. Catwoman by the end basically points it more to systemic (and Batman and Thomas Wayne's criticism of thinking they know better and actually makings things worse isn't undercut, which by itself is also institutional criticism), although it still feels like they could've done more. Maybe out of their hands by the studio or this as far as they could get away with vs. the producers (it almost felt like a struggle for Catwoman to outline her \"eat the rich\" mentality). Gotham itself is a mess of contradictions and it's OK to let the viewer lie between it all I guess.\r\n\r\nAlso the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is kinda slimy and male-centric. Catwoman, while great as a character, functionally falls to Batman's controlling force with a forced romance in the second act. Sure they're both suffering from trauma but Batman was literally using her despite it all, it at least understands the power gap more in the third act.\r\n\r\nThe end of the second act also spins its wheels a bit too much, the mystery pace kinda suffers a bit from focus and scenes get too drawn out (Riddler just disappears for a while). The movie could've been 20 minutes shorter. Doesn't stop it from having a terrific third act since most blockbusters have kinda sucked on that note\r\nAlthough speaking of Riddler, master class. Probably my favorite villain in a Batman film. \r\n\r\nThe aesthetic was gorgeous. I love its color grading and architecture, still thinking of the Wayne tower and its metal grates, goth hallways, and insane attention to detail that gets blurred out intentionally in the frame for most of the movie by Bruce's obliviousness to the world. It also keeps a balance of evoking the black/white movies while still being colorful, more of flooded black and oranges. I think of that sequence with Penguin not mainly for the fight itself (which to me was a bit messy) but moreso the flooded orange of the fire being the only color creating a sorta gradient on the black car, and how the flare at the end matches that aesthetic, that one color illuminating Batman leading everybody else to exit the frame, like a light in the darkness. Lovely\r\n\r\nThe music.... Giacchino just beat out his Incredibles score for me, masterful work with motifs, percussion, and rhythm. His mastery of percussion and horns during the lights out Batman hallway fight and how the horns blast, how well edited the percussion beat subtly goes through the Penguin chase and other fight sequences, Batman doesn't quite have a dance like Hong Kong films but the music makes it come close. The timpani and strings are so well used!!! Great use of Ave Maria both as soundtrack and score. Catwoman's motif? Amazing.\r\n\r\nThe performances are great all around. Finally a film with Turturro that I don't hate him. He's well restrained and perfectly cast, his dickish attitude now a strong point making him very memorable with very little screen time, much like Farrell in the same film. Kravitz made me the closest to tearing up with how she visually handles conflicting emotions, I still think about that scene with the voicemail where her eyes are all over the place and has trouble keeping it all together. Dano as Riddler is terrific.\r\n\r\nYep, this is my fav Batman film now.","created_at":"2022-03-27T15:39:50.559Z","id":"624085464cbe12005d584bd9","updated_at":"2022-03-28T15:38:17.308Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/624085464cbe12005d584bd9"},{"author":"aquiluus","author_details":{"name":"","username":"aquiluus","avatar_path":"/1ObeCO0rKmf97uOjzRtwLPbAY9K.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"This film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. There's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. So many layers and nuanced story telling. Gotham City feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. It feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.\r\n\r\nThere's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. It helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of Batman.\r\n\r\nBeing a diehard fan of Batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- I have to say; Matt Reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of Batman. Not once in this movie did he do something I felt was completely out of character and Robert Pattinson solidified the performance of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. I love Matt Reeves went to the extent to make sure this Batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. Yes, even Nolan. It should have to go without saying that Batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in Batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. That's how you do it.\r\n\r\nBringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite Batman film. So many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. I mean, Riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from Zero Year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of Batman's rouges gallery. Matt Reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard Batman fans, succeeding immensely.

A Batman beating Kurt's velvety drum Cobain, -didn't tell the subversive c revolutionary adence of Cobain, to think like that I would have to know that grunge swept hardrock -finally in the 90s- and buried Motley Crue, Guns and Roses and others, (yes, I mentioned him, Cobain, and not Nirvana that did not exist, that's why when we die we are left without this specific type of grunge, I already digressed, anyway) but yes, this Batman is doubly omniscient, an ego the size of Gotham City authorizes him (a) not only to -his first omniscience- speaking in the first person of himself when running the plot, that is to say in the events, \"I am revenge\" he says to the subway gang members, (scene that is not better than Todd Phillips' Koker subway, for give another example) that this happened -the first person- almost in all the other versions that precede it,it is also included here -its omniscience, obviously- dominating forensic or medical terms: \"eschimia\"? ask Batman of course!, but to (b), his second omniscience, being the narrator of his exploits in the first person, this again leads us to an Alan Moore influence but, with all due respect, as a clericot of Alan's genius Moore. When Batman wants to see the Penguin, he just has to be like the Penguin, appear in the doorway and announce himself, and please, for the fun of the plot, Batman almost spouts a sentence \"please tell me you won't let me in to unfold my money in the form of weapons hidden in my suit, and get in anyway. That is to say, the theatricality and the shadows of the bat, remained in the Babyboomer Generation or Generation X when the entrance was an \"appearance\" through shadows, suspicion and myth. The film is a complex mass because it is as if The Batman, The Batman 2 and 3 had been compressed and I am not only talking about the exhausting time of almost 3 hours, but also because of the number of common threads in which it was woven into a single feature film. For example, the plot increases its complexity first with a Riddler who is an anti-hero, because he indirectly helps Batman and the supposed common good and because of the premises that justify his murders, unmasking the big shots of the underworld at high levels of government, but later, arrested as Edward Nashton, he unmasks himself, that is, he turns himself in, sitting in that cafeteria just when, then yes, we will understand his \"fine\" intentions, and he becomes a true public order villain because he incites the revenge to the uncritical masses and followers of the disorder who have suffered or have resentments for any type of discrimination or corruption that they have suffered in Gotham city, (no more and no less than similar to the end of Todd Phillips' Joker);another complexity is with the cat The cat, I will not say Catwoman, who has her own drama for Kyle and at some point Batman leans on her, to spy on the Prosecutor and at least 2 times saves her from murdering her father Carmine Falcone and the his father's henchman. On the other hand, there is the added density or complexity of transcending and publishing the videos that show that the mother of Bruce Wayne, the mother of Batman had psychiatric problems in Arkham and hospitals and comes from a family that descendants who also had these difficulties and Thomas Wayne , trying to silence the journalist, he used the biggest thug Falcone. In other words, there is a possibility that Falcone, Catwoman's stepfather, is the one who murdered the Waynes that night because Batman's father was about to pity or denounce the next day that he only wanted to silence the journalist and NOT murder him as Falcone did. . In short, it is entertaining but poorly planned for a single feature film due to the enormous amount of detail that is handled.","created_at":"2022-04-02T05:17:04.458Z","id":"6247dc50014325004eb6cfe2","updated_at":"2022-06-15T19:20:18.204Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6247dc50014325004eb6cfe2"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"OK, shoot me now - but you can tell when you are watching a film at the cinema and the audience start to get a bit restless. Well mine did with this overlong, and frankly rather dreary film. The opening few, somewhat dystopian, scenes reminded me of \"Blade Runner\" (1982) and we do hit the ground running. Amidst an hotly contested mayoral election, a chap in a gas mask (\"The Riddler\", we learn later) brutally takes out the sitting candidate enticing the \"Batman\" (Robert Pattinson) to come help his policeman pal \"Gordon\" (Jeffrey Wright) to investigate. Seems that the killer wanted that to happen because he leaves our caped crusader a card with a clue. Soon the great and the good of the city are dropping like flies and a web of corruption and deceit at the top echelons of government is emerging. Personally I found this all a bit dull. It flows terribly slowly, and after a while the relentless darkness and a really pretty soporific, moody, effort from Pattinson just started to bore me. There are loads of plot holes - not least just how the \"Riddler\" manages to pull off some pretty heavy duty crimes without having to scale any tall buildings, or sneak past the heavily guarded victims of his spree. The scenes with the completely unprotected DA (Peter Sarsgaard) in a dimly lit street are just plain daft. Colin Farrell is probably my highlight as the duplicitous \"Oz\", and Zoë Kravitz (\"Cat Woman”) offers us some decent acrobatics but otherwise, this is an hugely over-rated affair that has a serious paucity of dialogue, is heavily scored and during it's almost three hours, not enough actually happens. Indeed, it is very reluctant to let us leave. I will admit that my first guess at the ending was a bit optimistic, but it could conclude at least another four times before we are finally allowed to stretch our legs. It might look better second time around, but for now it's nothing at all to write home about.","created_at":"2022-04-04T16:42:24.863Z","id":"624b1ff015a4a1006381e9cc","updated_at":"2022-04-04T16:42:24.863Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/624b1ff015a4a1006381e9cc"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Good albeit not great, this newest incarnation of Batman is well done if not also incredibly dark.

Still, being down with a mild case of Corona, I wanted something to watch that'd go down easy, and The Batman was available, so I picked it.\r\n\r\nI have to say that this, to me, is one of the rare superhero movies that appeal to me. And that's after having seen every other Batman movie since Tim Burton's 1989 one. And, I dare say, even with me being fed up with superhero movies, I think this is the best attempt.\r\n\r\nAt three hours, it feels like binge-watching a three-part miniseries. And by that I mean both that to the extent that it is three acts, they almost perfectly align with an hour each, and also that the pacing is great, and I never got bored.\r\n\r\nThe cast is excellent. Also, for the first time ever, I'm not thinking that it's ridiculous that no one recognizes Bruce Wayne as Batman. The half-mask actually makes Bruce Wayne unrecognizable. I'm not sure if they thought of that during casting, but it's really quite impressive.\r\n\r\nIt's also nice to not have to suffer through a pathetic attempt from Batman to make his voice sound cool. Oh dear, Christian Bale trying to look and sound cool was just so cringey. Robert Pattinson is by far the best Batman I've ever seen. The almost depressive mental torment he conveys does not come off as fake or pretension, and that's a first for the Batman franchise as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nThe mood is bleak without being depressive, the score is fantastic, if a bit too much, the cinematography is amazing, I really have very little to fault here. If anything, it may come off as a little pretentious and self-indulgent, but that's also part of the attraction, and if I'm being completely honest, I think it's more to do with my own \"people need to grow up and stop watching these childish things\" prejudice I have, when in fact the 15-year-old inside of me f...ing loves it, and I need to embrace that childish part of me rather than hate on it.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything I would change about this movie, it's what I feel is somewhat of a PG-ification of Batman. I would love to see this movie with all its bleak desperation and lust for vengeance on the depravity and evil in the Gotham world, but with a seriously anti-hero, all-violent, bringer-of-death Batman. I would love to see him - in a more crude outfit, with less bells and whistles, and definitely without the cape - destroy, slay and kill, with exploration of the terrible aftermath it would bring, including the impact on his psyche, rather than the beat-up-and-let-go strategy that he is using in this movie. That part just feels to not align with both the doomish mood that sets the story and the seeming existential depression of our masked protagonist. I think that would warrant yet another installment in this franchise. I'm actually surprised how much meat there is on this character.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the movie overall is consistently a bit too much, the ending takes it one notch further on that scale.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I now have two superhero movies that I keep in my movie collection. The other is Watchmen (Director's Cut).\r\n\r\n1 star deducted for Catwoman being racist without it being presented as a problem. The casting of her is perfect, by the way. Much better than Michelle Pfeiffer.","created_at":"2022-04-23T13:20:52.161Z","id":"6263fd340b5fd60f76b801f1","updated_at":"2022-06-15T19:19:29.579Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6263fd340b5fd60f76b801f1"},{"author":"Peter McGinn","author_details":{"name":"Peter McGinn","username":"narrator56","avatar_path":"/tVbrLJzA2RwRlE7dJLJG54UsAkq.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Oh boy, yet another review here on TMDB about this movie. What is it about comic books that garners so much interest? I am no longer a comic hero fan, either in movies or the source comic books. I have seen some of the Marvel series and the only one that I would watch multiple times if it came across my screen in Ant Man and the Wasp, with its wit, action and humor.\r\n\r\nI did read superhero comics as a kid, however. I stuck to DC comics. I especially liked the Legion of Superheroes, though I also read the Justice League, Superman and Batman. This was the Silver Age of comics, I believe, before they restarted and complicated the field with reimagining the comic universe (or whatever it is they did).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was a DC boy so I gave The Batman a look see. It is a dark film, both in its themes and its camera work. No wit and humor to speak of here, just grim and introspective comic book noir. But it was intriguing and interesting enough to hold only my attention. There were a couple of interesting twists on traditional Batman villains, for example. As with a lot of current thrillers, there is quite a body count, when sometimes with violence, I think less can be more.\r\n\r\nIt is not a film I will watch multiple times or anxiously await a sequel for, but I do not regret the time spent watching it.","created_at":"2022-04-27T09:39:42.003Z","id":"62690f5d38765101658093c5","updated_at":"2022-04-27T09:39:42.003Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62690f5d38765101658093c5"},{"author":"mahmus","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mahmus","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81229675f9bf20351c28ec489e561307.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"_The Batman_ is the best live-action Batman movie yet. It's the type of Batman film I've been waiting for my whole life.\r\n\r\nIt's dark and realistic, but also stylish and large-scale. It's not limited by a commitment to realism like the Dark Knight trilogy, nor is it burdened by a shared universe like the DCEU. It is its own thing. A moody, disturbing, visually stunning, David Fincher-inspired, three hour long detective epic with some of the best interpretations of the characters ever put on screen.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson is fantastic as a younger, moodier, and yes, more emo Batman. Paul Dano is straight up terrifying as the Riddler. Colin Farrell is unrecognisable in more ways than one as The Penguin and Zoë Kravitz is easily my favorite live-action Catwoman.

It's almost three hours long but it feels like two.\r\n\r\nThis is the best Batman movie. The Dark Knight is good and all, but Reeves finds the perfect mix of gritty realism and style (Nolan would never even dare to have a snorricam shot of Batmam gliding over the city), and finally gives us a live-action Batman that lives up to the title of \"World's Greatest Detective\".

Hang on? So why did I only give it 2 out of 5 stars? Well, this is really personal but, to me, it is not a good Batman movie. I really had problems writing this review because it is a very good movie. I just did not like it as a Batman movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie is really dark, gritty and noir. Not really a problem. It works for some movies. But it is also quite slow at the beginning and the first quarter of the movie was actually boring. Remember, this is a three hour movie so a quarter is more than half an hour of “boringness”.\r\n\r\nThe “boringess” was broken up by a pretty cool car chase. Some people seem to not really like the batmobile and I have to say that it was not very inspired but it was not all bad either. Unfortunately the movie turned rather boring for a while again after that.\r\n\r\nThe movie tries to bring out more of the detective part of Batman than the previous movies, which is fine, but there is just too much moping around with Batman / Bruce Wayne walking around oozing sadness all around him.\r\n\r\nActually, this brings us to my main gripe with this movie. The choice of actor for the Batman is just wrong for me. He is more like a sad puppy than the Batman. The script that makes him mope around, have emotional outbreaks and, occasionally, being downright stupid like just staring dumbfounded when explosives go off in his face does not really help of course.\r\n\r\nTo me the Selina Kyle character had more charisma than the Batman, especially when the Batman was in his Bruce Wayne alter ego.\r\n\r\nAnd I really, really dislike that twist about Bruce’s parents. That was such a lazy Hollywood writer hack thing to do just to create (unwanted) drama.\r\n\r\nThen we have the Riddler. Compared to the charismatic villains that we have come to expect he is just a sad little psychopath with a bunch of equally sad fanatical internet followers.\r\n\r\nNow, all of this would have worked great if it had been a movie about some, unspecified, vigilante. The movie is really well done. The detective story, the action (especially towards the end) and the noir setting would have worked great. Even at its three hour bloated length it would have been great although cut down to two hours or a bit more would have been even better. If it had not been a Batman movie!","created_at":"2022-08-14T13:11:41.626Z","id":"62f8f48d258823007f6074ce","updated_at":"2022-08-14T13:11:41.737Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62f8f48d258823007f6074ce"},{"author":"JPRetana","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPRetana","avatar_path":"/eYudFTVvIpCweDVQEl878whalTy.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"The Batman is not a terribly bad movie, but it would be twice as good if it were half as long. How a film that likes to take shortcuts – especially with the Riddler’s ‘riddles’ – can still take almost three hours to get to where it’s going, I haven’t the foggiest (but then this is a rather strange enterprise that gives us Andy Serkis in the flesh and covers Colin Farrell in prosthetic makeup and a fat suit). Director/co-writer Matt Reeves very wisely avoids origin stories and takes for granted relationships, which have already been well established in a decades-long canon, between certain characters; on the other hand, he allows his movie to become bogged down at the halfway point in a deluge of backstory.\r\n\r\nThe obvious problem is that there is enough material here for at least two films, and Reeves attempts to cram it all into a single one. Why? We all know there are going to be sequels, so why not save some for the next chapter? Or better yet, why not leave some of it on the cutting room floor? There is absolutely no reason for the Penguin to be in this movie; he might as well be the Imperceptible Man (an actual Batman villain, mind you) for all that he’s given to do. Catwoman has been pretty much played out, and as far as the Riddler, I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but Jim Carrey did a much better job with the role than does Paul Dano – an otherwise fine actor that inexplicably chose to play the character as the bastard child of Heath Ledger’s Joker and Tom Hardy’s Bane. That leaves Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who provides the most intriguing plot points; why not make him the main, or even – dare I say it – only villain?\r\n\r\nNow, The Batman is long enough to try the patient of a saint, but at least it’s great to look at. Like the first Tim Burton Batman (as described by the unerring Roger Ebert), it “is a triumph of design over story, style over substance - a great-looking movie with a plot you can’t care much about.” Gotham City in particular is a winning combination of Burton’s faux noir texture and Christopher Nolan’s plausible architecture. The best scenes involve Batman (Robert Pattinson) and Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) – and indeed Pattinson has an uncanny knack for playing off veteran character actors – as a sort of pre-Robin dynamic duo; their adventures are poignant because they appear to happen in the real world, or at least as real as a world can be wherein a grown man disguises himself as a giant bat (compare last year’s Zack Snyder's Justice League, with its unending CGI assault on the senses).","created_at":"2022-08-27T04:00:14.031Z","id":"630996ce6e938a007bf1f5fe","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:29:05.670Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630996ce6e938a007bf1f5fe"},{"author":"Dean","author_details":{"name":"Dean","username":"Ditendra","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4172cb0f573872484d9c3a4aa13ce65c.jpg","rating":3.0},"content":"This was the worst Batman I have ever seen. \r\n\r\nFirstly, Robert Pattinson was the worst choice for the Batman role.

Even older movie versions had a better mask than here. Batman's batmobile also sucked. Looked like a downgraded version. He also rode just a simple bike and lastly, he couldn't even glide with his default Batman suit. Also, don't know why but James Gordon was played by a black actor, while in every movie and even in every game this character is white.

So, in general cast and acting was disappointing in this movie.\r\n\r\nLastly, the movie itself... It was dull, boring and depressive.

The family lives in a magical home that is the center point for the community and is loved by the community.\r\n\r\nIn the new Disney film “Encanto”; audiences are told the story of how the family patriarch founded the community with a magical candle and how upon reaching a certain age; all members of her family receive a “gift” from the magical house which gives them an ability to help the community. From being able to heal with cooking to talking to the animals and super strength; the family Madrigal is the beloved pillar of the community.\r\n\r\nTo every rule there is an exception and young Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz); is the only member of her family not to receive a gift of powers. As such she is seen as a pariah from the family and believes she is more tolerated than loved especially compared to her siblings who are endowed with amazing abilities.\r\n\r\nThings change when a new member of the family goes through the gifting ceremony; the first one since Mirabel was denied, and receives an amazing gift and basks in the love of the town and family. Mirabel has a vision of the house cracking and falling into ruin. She tries to warn her family but they see the house in its usual pristine condition and blame Mirabel for being jealous for not having a gift and wanting to take attention away from those who do.\r\n\r\nMirabel believes in what she saw and learns that members of her family may know more than they admit and that they hold the key to saving the day. This leads to a quest to find the absent Uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo); who has been absent as many believe his gift of prophecy only leads to bad things coming to fruition and has gone into hiding as a result.\r\n\r\nMirabel is soon forced to look deep inside herself and find her strength to overcome her own insecurities and save her family and community.\r\n\r\nThe film has great animation and is awash in color as it brings the magical community to life. The music is lively and is what you would expect from Lin- Manuel Miranda as it brings joy and energy to the film that is in keeping with the Disney tradition of amazing music in their animated films.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue that I had with the film is that while fun and entertaining; the story never took the next step forward and at times dragged. This is not to say that “Encanto” is a bad film as it is lively, colorful, and fun; however it does not reach the heights of Disney classics like “Frozen” “Moana” and other classics. Think of it this way; “Lilo & Stitch” is a fine animated film but few would hold it in the same regard as “The Lion King”, “Beauty and the Beast”, and “The Little Mermaid”.\r\n\r\nIn the end “Encanto” offers a fun experience for the family and fans to enjoy and shows how even when they do not hit the top of the mountain; Disney is still the Gold Standard in animation.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-11-15T18:00:27.577Z","id":"6192a03b458199002a36d926","updated_at":"2021-11-15T18:00:27.577Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6192a03b458199002a36d926"},{"author":"John Critic","author_details":{"name":"John Critic","username":"kdumers","avatar_path":"/1H3ot9uQYijHXK5esGZ6ExlaRqk.jpg","rating":null},"content":"Disney’s marvelous computer animated feature since Coco!!!","created_at":"2021-12-11T17:29:57.947Z","id":"61b4e015037264004124cef0","updated_at":"2021-12-14T17:57:23.317Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61b4e015037264004124cef0"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"A strong new entry into the Walt Disney Animation Studios canon.\r\n\r\n<em>'Encanto'</em> is an enjoyable and meaningful 102 minutes. The animation, as you expect from Disney, is superb and the world really comes alive beautifully and vibrantly. I like the character designs and their story, with each one having something unique about them which is neat.\r\n\r\nI had heard that some of the music from this 2021 flick has entered the charts here in the United Kingdom, though I purposely avoided listening to it as I wanted to keep it fresh for when I watched the film. Now I've done just that, I found the music to be very good - aside from \"Surface Pressure\" (no. 3 in UK), I don't think I'll be listening to any of it on my own time but - more importantly - it's impressively effective for the movie itself. \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" might grow on me, mind.\r\n\r\nThe cast are fun. Stephanie Beatriz leads comfortably as Mirabel, while John Leguizamo is a great choice to play Bruno. The rest of the cast, though nothing extraordinary in my opinion, are all entertaining enough in their respective roles - namely María Cecilia Botero and Jessica Darrow.","created_at":"2022-03-04T15:32:48.569Z","id":"622231205a07f50072f586f7","updated_at":"2022-03-04T15:32:48.569Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/622231205a07f50072f586f7"},{"author":"SpotaMovie.com","author_details":{"name":"SpotaMovie.com","username":"bastag","avatar_path":"/h9FkucYmSN3YH5OmrNRWO5rdquS.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Full Analysis at Spotamovie.com - **Intro** - Encanto is a movie for those looking for purpose and those families seeking the secret for true happiness.

One could argue that it brings a new petri dish full of meddling scientists facing the consequences of their actions, while conversely it justifiably feels like a Cronenberg knock-off.\r\n\r\nPsychological discord is in abundance, with its slants on skew-whiff parenting giving the pic a dark fascination, and as unpleasant as the male fantasy angle is, it does hold a morbid interest factor.\r\n\r\nYet come the final third the makers let things run away from them, the bonkers dangers of tampering with science giving way to daft schlock, even managing to be distasteful in the process - while the finale is a weak attempt at a \"TBC\" cliff hanger.\r\n\r\nLead cast members are turning in good perfs. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley as the meddling science couple hold court well, and Delphine Chaneac as the Chimera splicer of the piece really nails all the various emotional strands required for a tricky role.\r\n\r\nDirector Vincenzo Natali  has shown with Cube and Cypher he has something to offer the horror/sci-fi splinters of film, but this is a mixed bag. A film of great ideas let down by overheating the plot for shock values, while the levity inserted into the play is misguided and damaging for dramatic worth. 6/10","created_at":"2018-12-02T16:23:33.783Z","id":"5c04070592514113290ab255","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:14.826Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5c04070592514113290ab255"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"\"Clive\" (Adrien Brody) and \"Elsa\" (Sarah Polley) are a couple of genetic engineers charged by David Hewlett's \"Barlow\" with discovering an important gene that could lead to huge advances in medical science. Using a mix of human and animal DNA that have varying degrees of success before the evolution of a creature \"Dren\" (Delphine Chanéac) that develops more human attributes - as well as a tail with a stinger and the ability to grow wings. As we progress through this frankly rather disturbing story, we discover that \"Elsa\" quite literally has skin in the game as they must both seek to protect their creation from not just their employers but from her increasingly violent and lustful tendencies. I was quite interested in the underlying premise but the execution here is really poor. I never did really get why Brody was ever successful in the first place and here there is no chemistry between him and Polley; the storyline which could have been challenging and thought-provoking instead borders on the absurdly far-fetched and the ending couldn't really come quick enough as we really do struggle to reach any sort of a satisfactory conclusion - either from a personal or a scientific perspective.

A boozy lunch with with some screenwriters who had just seen \"Vivarium\" (2019) and began to recall \"Stepford Wives\" (2004) and the \"Truman Show\" (1998). We know, say the assembled talent - let's write a pointless hybrid of these stories, making sure to avoid the best bits of any of them then get two gorgeous people to take part. We'll end up minted! Well they may well have ended up making loads of cash, but what they have provided for us is an heavily stylised story that goes nowhere fast. To be fair, Florence Pugh tries quite hard as \"Alice\", the increasingly disturbed wife of \"Jack\" (Harry Styles). They live in an Utopian desert community where the men all head to work for \"Frank\" (Chris Pine) in the morning and the women do the standard middle class housework, shopping and networking things. All is idyllic until \"Alice\" notices that one of their neighbours \"Margaret\" (KiKi Layne) is convinced that something is amiss amidst their perfect lifestyle. When an inexplicable tragedy ensues, \"Alice\" starts to have nightmares and soon her marriage and his career prospects are in jeopardy. Pine isn't the least menacing as the duplicitous \"Frank\" and though the camera really does love Styles, he has little here to demonstrate whether he can actually act or can just fill a perfectly tailored suit as well as Daniel Craig. That's really the problem here. The film looks good, but the plot is completely undercooked. We are delivered of a partially formed plot that is derivative and, frankly, rather dull. The last few scenes with the guys in red reminded me of a television commercial for Vodaphone and at just over two hours long, I was just unengaged with it all. Styles' looks will take him far and working with the likes of Pugh and Pine will only help him, but unless his people work harder on the scripts and characterisations, then he will just end up Zac Efron-light. This is a film for television in due course, I'd say.","created_at":"2022-09-26T07:51:08.654Z","id":"633159ecd38b580092a8ca25","updated_at":"2022-09-26T07:51:08.756Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/633159ecd38b580092a8ca25"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"I thought this was great.\r\n\r\nI only knew of the off-screen drama about <em>'Don’t Worry Darling'</em>, thankfully I hadn't read or seen anything at all about the plot - which, obviously, helped my enjoyment. As such, I was extremely interested in the first chunk of this. It builds up nicely, revealing details here and there. The ending isn't as strong but I still dig it, don't get me wrong.\r\n\r\nThe cast are terrific, even if Florence Pugh completely wipes the floor with her co-stars... and I don't mean that negatively on them one bit, it's simply a case of Pugh giving an outstanding performance. This is only the third film of her's that I've seen... gotta watch more!\r\n\r\nAway from Pugh, I was impressed by Harry Styles. He can act. I will say, though, that Shia LaBeouf would've been greater in the role though. Elsewhere, Olivia Wilde (also dir.), Chris Pine and Gemma Chan do good things.\r\n\r\nIs it a perfect film? Not at all. Is it entertaining? Sure is. Each to their own, but I thoroughly enjoyed this 2022 release.","created_at":"2022-10-11T19:19:01.690Z","id":"6345c1a507e2810082f147f5","updated_at":"2022-10-11T19:19:09.793Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6345c1a507e2810082f147f5"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"It is no surprise that _Don't Worry Darling_ has been marred with public controversies and poor critic reception, but is it really bad as the media would want you to believe? While I admit, there are plenty of issues in the story department, like completely abandoning certain plot details as they are introduced or leaving certain character plots half-baked to name a few, the other aspects of this film really make this an enjoyable viewing experience.\r\n\r\nOlivia Wilde's direction is actually really well done here. I could tell that certain shots and elements were done with the specific intent to create a romanticized version of the 1950's while still giving glimpses of something sinister hidden underneath. Although it is a shame that these elements didn't lead to much in terms of a reveal at the end.\r\n\r\nThe acting is a mixed bag here. Florence Pugh and Chris Pine absolutely carry this film. Pugh carries such complex emotions and is able to show her internal struggles while putting on a pretty face for appearance sakes. It is captivating and the audience can completely be resonant with her, this connection makes her character easy to root for. Chris Pine was really sinister in this role. I have not seen him as a villain in many shows and he does a fantastic job. For whatever reason, his mannerisms really reminded me of James Spader in Avengers: Age of Ultron, and that is a complement. Pine was not giving much screen time or character development, but he does the most with what he has. Olivia Wildes was fine, do not really have any complaints really, wasn't great but wasn't bad. Harry Styles' performance is hard to pinpoint. While I don’t think he did bad, but when he is constantly sharing the screen with Pughe, he is overshadowed a lot and his deficiencies show much more.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was disappointed with _Don't Worry Darling_ and the potential that was there to be such a special film. But it was still a good film that I had a fun time in.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _69%_\r\n**Verdict:** _Good_","created_at":"2022-10-14T18:04:17.410Z","id":"6349a4a1414291009882333b","updated_at":"2022-10-14T18:04:17.509Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6349a4a1414291009882333b"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/opinion-pieces/what-do-both-dont-worry-darling-and-crimes-of-the-future-have-in-common\r\n\r\n\"Personally, I believe that cinematic narratives with multiple plot points and questions related to the world itself are too often confused and envisioned as character studies driven by a single protagonist.\r\n\r\nBoth Olivia Wilde and David Cronenberg complete their movies when the main character fulfills the minimum requirements of their arc, consequently renouncing all other equally significant issues worthy of in-depth exploration. In the case of Don't Worry Darling, one finishes it with an underwhelming feeling from an unsurprising conclusion, while in Crimes of the Future, viewers are left with several questions and interesting, half-developed paths about such a mesmerizing futuristic world.\r\n\r\nNeither film explores its own world-building satisfactorily.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-","created_at":"2022-10-16T09:56:15.543Z","id":"634bd53fe263bb009c4f9b55","updated_at":"2022-10-16T09:56:15.628Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/634bd53fe263bb009c4f9b55"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"**Don't Worry Darling has a lot going for it, but its script keeps it from being more than a pretty coat of paint on a mediocre story told several times before.**\r\n\r\nDon't Worry Darling is a new take on The Stepford Wives. Same basic story with some fantastic cinematography, great costuming, beautiful visuals, and committed, top-notch performances from the cast. But all that is lost in a script that gets stuck on coming up with as many ways as possible to show its characters' slipping sanity rather than telling a complete story. The plot twists were pretty easy to guess, and the finale ended abruptly without providing any conclusion or resolution for the character. With all the bright spots this film had to offer, the sloppy story squandered all its high points leaving me let down and a little bored even with an exciting climax. With that said, I'm still trying to figure out what could have been done to make this story more compelling. The Stepford Wives concept has been done several times before and seems always to fail to find a way to end with a satisfying resolution.","created_at":"2022-10-28T05:07:18.237Z","id":"635b6386f28838007b158ae7","updated_at":"2022-10-28T05:07:18.295Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/635b6386f28838007b158ae7"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":5},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1586169,"title":"Don't Worry Darling","original_title":"Don't Worry Darling","plot_overview":"Alice and Jack are lucky to be living in the idealized community of Victory, the experimental company town housing the men who work for the top-secret Victory Project and their families.

It’s as if the story throws a ball in the air for every concept in the film (Alzheimer’s, human trafficking, the FBI vs the police, rich people getting whatever they want, etc) only to allow each ball to smack against the ground without trying to catch them after their initial toss. For a film about a guy who kills people with the authorities chasing him for nearly two hours, _Memory_ is a monotonous bore. Not even Liam Neeson lighting himself on fire to cauterize a bullet wound can save what is otherwise a forgetful and fatigued memoir of a hoary hit man.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Memory-2022-Review-A-Forgetful-and-Fatigued-Memoir-of-a-Hoary-Hit-Man","created_at":"2022-04-30T04:14:17.762Z","id":"626cb799d7107e0050a2fc39","updated_at":"2022-04-30T04:14:17.762Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/626cb799d7107e0050a2fc39"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1646370,"title":"Memory","original_title":"Memory","plot_overview":"Alex, an assassin-for-hire, finds that he's become a target after he refuses to complete a job for a dangerous criminal organization.

We Collided is fond of quoting Wuthering Heights, but it owes more to Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey (the novel, called After, whose film adaptation this is the sequel to, originally appeared on Wattpad, where every asshole can publish regardless of whether or not they should).\r\n\r\nUnlike Heathcliff and Catherine (and by extension Romeo and Juliet, begetters of all modern star-crossed lovers), though, Tessa (Josephine Langford) and Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) have absolutely no impediment to their being together other than that they are totally wrong for each other.\r\n\r\nThe only chemistry between the two is sexual; After We Collided is much more lubricious than Twilight, but a lot less risqué than 50 Shades — that is, there’s lots of implied sex but very little nudity. Since there is no reason for these two to be together, we don't give two craps if they aren't.\r\n\r\nNot that the movie doesn’t try to manufacture such a reason; for example, Emotionally Scarred Bad Boy Hardin (Tiffin may be Ralph Fiennes’s nephew, but comes across more as a young, Brittish-accented Joshua Jackson) has nightmares, but they stop when he starts dating Tessa. This is is total nonsense; sleeping with someone doesn’t equal sleeping better.\r\n\r\nBut that’s the film’s naïve Love Conques All mentality. Love may indeed conquer many things, but an inert, lethargic plot is not one of them. The only part of the script that doesn't ring hollow is the title, which is very appropriate because the action, such as it is, completely lacks urgency. Nothing is resolved now, everything is left for later — to the point that two sequels were in the works at the time of this one’s release.","created_at":"2022-09-05T22:55:01.602Z","id":"63167e45fab3fa007f3e3910","updated_at":"2022-09-05T22:55:13.910Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63167e45fab3fa007f3e3910"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}},{"id":1583182,"title":"After

But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.\r\n\r\nDirector Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.\r\n\r\nThe characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious \"who done it\" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.\r\n\r\nOwls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10","created_at":"2019-07-24T23:48:19.801Z","id":"5d38ee43b1f68d0012c2abea","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:24.794Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d38ee43b1f68d0012c2abea"},{"author":"Venti_Pro","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Venti_Pro","avatar_path":null,"rating":null},"content":"Alright first lets start with my problems with this movie.\r\nSome of the effects do not hold up and that can take away from the magic or suspense.\r\nThe child actors are not very good at acting in this movie.\r\n It is way to easy to nitpick this movie and all the nitpicks can be very distracting.\r\nI think the main theme was used way to much in the beginning and that kind of took the magic out of the main theme for me.\r\nI personally did not get sucked into this world which made me kind of bored at times.\r\nPeople love the harry potter movies but these movies don't really click with me when it comes to characters, the lore, and the magic and I think the full story of harry potter is to drawn out and I just want the movies to get to the point.\r\nFor me if the ending of the film is not very satisfying my respect for the movie drops a ton and I don't think the ending of this movie was very satisfying!\r\nThe villain in this movie is super basic.\r\nNow on to the good stuff!\r\nI like how most of the scenes build up the characters, show us some magic, and it builds up the mystery!\r\nI like the sets and costumes a lot!\r\nI like most of the music!","created_at":"2021-08-09T19:00:55.691Z","id":"61117b67344a8e005e2c2056","updated_at":"2021-08-10T18:05:08.865Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61117b67344a8e005e2c2056"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1159480,"title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","original_title":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","plot_overview":"Harry Potter has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house his whole life.

This film is certainly guilty of that, with the first half hour spent on way too much character establishment that really has very little to do with the gist of the story. Once it does get going though, it's a cleverly crafted and well put together scary movie centred around \"Finn\" (Mason Thames). Bullied at school, he is protected by his friend \"Robin\" (Miguel Cazarez Mora) until he disappears. He isn't the first child to disappear either, indeed five from this small community have gone missing over the last few weeks. \"Finn\" is walking home after school when he encounters a man who has dropped his groceries. Offering to help, next thing he knows he is in a grubby basement with only a soiled mattress and a disconnected phone on the wall. His mask-clad captor - who has something of the \"Joker\" about him - insists he is in no danger, but the phone on the wall starts to ring and the callers - the other five victims - warn him otherwise, and help him to try to best his nemesis. There are one or two jump moments, but mostly there is an effectively accumulating sense of menace well fuelled by confident efforts from Thames and his sister \"Gwen\" (Madeleine McGraw) who might have inherited her mother's ability to see the future in dreams - a skill that may prove vital in helping the police save her brother from certain death. There are violent undertones, but very little actual violence is shown as the young man comes to terms with some of his own demons and to try to escape. The last ten minutes redeem it well, and there is something distinctly satisfying about the conclusion. Scott Derrickson has provided us with one of the better Blumhouse dramas of recent years that is sure worth a watch.","created_at":"2022-06-25T06:24:38.927Z","id":"62b6aa269566580052bd4211","updated_at":"2022-06-25T06:26:16.804Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62b6aa269566580052bd4211"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"With supernatural dread lifted directly from the likes of _Stir of Echoes_ and _The Sixth Sense_, _The Black Phone_ features a breakthrough performance from Madeleine McGraw while Ethan Hawke’s hauntingly memorable turn as The Grabber is felt in a hair-raising sense; like someone who has unknowingly snuck up behind you and waits in your peripheral for that dramatic reveal. _The Black Phone_ is a solid, pulse racing horror film that packs a punch, but seems like the type of film that simply won’t be as delectable on repeat viewings.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Black-Phone-2022-Review-A-Juvenile-Curtain-Call-of-Death","created_at":"2022-06-26T23:13:53.642Z","id":"62b8e8312e2b2c031ceb6121","updated_at":"2022-06-26T23:13:53.642Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62b8e8312e2b2c031ceb6121"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/the-black-phone-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"The Black Phone carries a horror premise with a supernatural touch full of potential, but it plays too safe by betting on a narrative that's too simple, predictable, and repetitive.\r\n\r\nScott Derrickson elevates his work with a distinct style, and the fact that the main focus belongs to the protagonists development rather than on generic jumpscares pleases me.\r\n\r\nMason Thames and Madeleine McGraw are, without a doubt, the most impressive elements of the entire film, delivering two of the best performances by young actors of the last decade.

The movie does a great job setting up the main characters in the beginning that gives you a relationship with them and genuine desire for them to succeed. There are a few plot points that are a little questionable, but are they are minor nitpicks and didn’t pull me out of the story too much. The performances all around were great. Ethan Hawke does fantastic in his limited screen time. He conveys the mental state of the Grabber with such nuance, it really makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. The children do very well too, especially in the more emotionally heavy scenes. A few of the classmates performances in the beginning were a bit awkward.  Overall, I had a great time with this movie and it is a testament to the directors and writers that they could adapt such a creative thriller from a short story.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Great_","created_at":"2022-07-05T13:50:18.078Z","id":"62c4419a2da84606af361e6d","updated_at":"2022-07-15T15:19:08.761Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62c4419a2da84606af361e6d"},{"author":"Horseface","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Horseface","avatar_path":"/zDc2il1Js8wfo2PeV9hUI8eiPbk.png","rating":1.0},"content":"I had to abandon this very early on, as I couldn't see anything.

The previous victims of the killer start calling Charlie on an out-of-service phone. These chilling calls give the boy a chance to save himself and others from the killer's clutches.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK PHONE is suspenseful and scary without the need to have onscreen violence (the violence is mostly off-screen). The cast is excellent, particularly Thames and McGraw, who both give standout performances. Thames is particularly convincing as the terrified boy who is trying to make sense of the situation he's in. Hawke is also chilling as the killer, though his character is not as fleshed out as I would have liked. The movie is well-made and well-acted and has a solid story with some creepy moments — and the length is exactly right. An enjoyable addition to the genre.","created_at":"2022-08-14T07:06:21.556Z","id":"62f89eed724de1007a0160e7","updated_at":"2022-08-14T07:06:21.612Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62f89eed724de1007a0160e7"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Had some decently suspense-filled moments and Ethan Hawke was great but otherwise I found most of this pretty forgettable, yet still worth watching as a rental. **3.25/5**","created_at":"2022-08-18T21:15:59.061Z","id":"62feac0f6a3448007a2a7754","updated_at":"2022-08-18T21:15:59.181Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62feac0f6a3448007a2a7754"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"**Not quite a full-on horror movie but a well-done creepy thriller.**\r\n\r\nI love a good Blumhouse flick (and honestly, I love the bad Blumhouse flicks too).

Using a combination of guile and brass neck, he is soon in situ, where he encounters the cynical journalist Arthur Coates (Russell Crowe) before embarking on his trek to deliver his beer. If it were not fact, it would really beggar belief this - the hand that serendipity plays in ensuring not just his safety, but the manner in which he blags his way around this tortured land, is sometimes just a little too difficult to believe. Efron is never going to be a good versatile actor, but to give him his due he delivers well enough here with a decent script and once we enter the final phase that involves more of a contribution from Crowe, the film picks up giving us some indication of just how perilous life was for those facing the Viet Cong's stealthy advance. It's not without it's humour and it illustrates amusingly just how afraid everyone was of falling foul of the CIA - a confusion which he was able to take advantage of on a regular basis! It's a tale of camaraderie in it's truest form, and though not really a cinema film, is at the better end of the Apple productions we have seen so far. It is half an hour too long - it takes way too long to get going, but once we are in Asia, it's a watchable enough drama.","created_at":"2022-10-08T18:25:23.083Z","id":"6341c0931b7c590081bf481a","updated_at":"2022-10-08T18:25:23.190Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6341c0931b7c590081bf481a"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1588098,"title":"The Greatest Beer Run Ever","original_title":"The Greatest Beer Run Ever","plot_overview":"Chickie wants to support his friends fighting in Vietnam, so he does something wild—personally bring them American beer.

Having those elements would have at least given fans of the franchise thus far hope that Disney had a vision of where to take Ice Age in the foreseeable future. Instead we get this lackluster dud of a film that is boring to look at and is mostly massively unfunny while making most of the characters – old and new – forgettable. When Zee first meets Crash and Eddie, Buck says something along the lines of, “What they lack in courage they make up for with bumbling ineptitude.” That is all _The Adventures of Buck Wild_ is; an unnecessary animated excursion into bumbling ineptitude.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Ice-Age-Adventures-of-Buck-Wild-2022-Review-An-Inept-Spleen-Powered-Blemish-of-Animation","created_at":"2022-01-30T12:55:47.969Z","id":"61f68ad3109230001b397e75","updated_at":"2022-01-30T12:55:47.969Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61f68ad3109230001b397e75"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1628426,"title":"The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild","original_title":"The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild","plot_overview":"The fearless one-eyed weasel Buck teams up with mischievous possum brothers Crash & Eddie as they head off on a new adventure into Buck's home: The Dinosaur World.","type":"movie","runtime_minutes":82,"year":2022,"end_year":null,"release_date":"2022-01-28","imdb_id":"tt13634480","tmdb_id":774825,"tmdb_type":"movie","genres":[3,4,2,8],"genre_names":["Adventure","Animation","Comedy","Family"],"user_rating":5.1,"critic_score":24,"us_rating":"PG","poster":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/posters/01628426_poster_w185.jpg","backdrop":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/backdrops/01628426_bd_w780.jpg","original_language":"en","similar_titles":[1163731,1352411,1476124,1322096,1451014,124259,1245636,1672798,1158450,1144412,1305835,1410049,1288261,1291397,1356508,1616147,195960,1673126,1471896,169014,4112992,1667023,1410048,4151097,1151667],"networks":null,"network_names":[],"relevance_percentile":98.53,"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh4CxwRU8Dc","trailer_thumbnail":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/video_thumbnails/629502_pthumbnail_320.jpg","sources":[{"source_id":372,"name":"Disney+","type":"sub","region":"US","ios_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","android_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","web_url":"https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/the-ice-age-adventures-of-buck-wild/43OJuKxe9b9Y","format":"HD","price":null,"seasons":null,"episodes":null}]}],[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/vIgyYkXkg6NC2whRbYjBD7eb3Er.jpg","belongs_to_collection":{"id":558216,"name":"Venom Collection","poster_path":"/unpRHoS5df7VEukeukCAgHU1sV2.jpg","backdrop_path":"/rhLspFB1B8ZCkWEHFYmc3NKagzq.jpg"},"budget":110000000,"genres":[{"id":878,"name":"Science Fiction"},{"id":28,"name":"Action"},{"id":12,"name":"Adventure"}],"homepage":"https://www.venom.movie","id":580489,"imdb_id":"tt7097896","original_language":"en","original_title":"Venom: Let There Be Carnage","overview":"After finding a host body in investigative reporter Eddie Brock, the alien symbiote must face a new enemy, Carnage, the alter ego of serial killer Cletus Kasady.","popularity":322.73,"poster_path":"/rjkmN1dniUHVYAtwuV3Tji7FsDO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/lieeAioEBVsgsoDT9HICrdt5iRa.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7505,"logo_path":"/837VMM4wOkODc1idNxGT0KQJlej.png","name":"Marvel Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":53462,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matt Tolmach Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":84041,"logo_path":"/nw4kyc29QRpNtFbdsBHkRSFavvt.png","name":"Pascal Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":166230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avi Arad Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":506863592,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venom: Let There Be Carnage","video":false,"vote_average":6.922,"vote_count":8213,"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bloopers -

Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.\r\n\r\nAt the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus’s cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as “Carnage”.\r\n\r\nCletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.\r\n\r\nAs any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.\r\n\r\nThere have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.\r\n\r\nWhat we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.\r\n\r\nDirector Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.\r\n\r\nThe plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any “wow” moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.\r\n\r\nFor me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.\r\n\r\nFor now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-09-30T13:48:10.279Z","id":"6155c01a8e2ba6008bdb3393","updated_at":"2021-09-30T13:48:10.279Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6155c01a8e2ba6008bdb3393"},{"author":"Cal","author_details":{"name":"Cal","username":"bycalvin","avatar_path":null,"rating":7.0},"content":"Let There be Carnage!\r\n\r\nIt is a not bad movie to watch.

The movie does not give a ton of back story on the dual villains in the story but they show the love they have for one another.  \r\n\r\nThe movie is short and very fast pace.  It also has plenty of comedy between the hosts and the symbiotes.  \r\n\r\nOverall the movie sets up for a Venom 3 and an inclusion of Venom into the MCU.  If the relationship between Sony & Marvel can continue to be good fans of the franchise will have a bright future ahead.","created_at":"2021-10-16T00:40:23.907Z","id":"616a1f77924ce6008d09fb70","updated_at":"2021-10-25T21:29:12.310Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/616a1f77924ce6008d09fb70"},{"author":"RADIO1'S MR.

The film also boasts what feels like an accelerated pace that moves the story from action sequence to action sequence before coming to an end rather quickly, leaving _Venom: Let There Be Carnage_ to stand as one of those a special kind of stupid blockbuster endeavors that, every so often, strikes idiotic gold.\r\n\r\nThe sequel is a definite improvement over the first film in the sense that it totally embraces its stupidity resulting in a comic book film that feels light, silly, and amusingly psychotic all at the same time.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2021/10/05/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-idiotic-gold/","created_at":"2021-12-14T22:03:45.696Z","id":"61b914c1cb75d10096f85f9a","updated_at":"2021-12-14T22:03:45.696Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61b914c1cb75d10096f85f9a"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Passably entertaining sequel that is better than the original though I found that one utterly bland.

Once a bad guy (though not in this universe apparently) he now tries to do the right thing while keeping within acceptable norms to exist among humans.  \r\nThis movie was a good attempt but, it came across as contrived and a bit cookie cutter as far as the bad guys, Woody Harrelson and Naomi Harris, were portrayed.  Psychoes enjoying newfound freedom after a fail death sentence, and lifelong incarceration is soooooo....bland.  In short, \"It's been done (before).\"  \r\n\r\nThe story from there is hit 'n miss with comedy, plot, and tension.  The movie pretty much happens in that manner as well.  It jumps as if each of the scenes are little movies banded together with no smooth transitions : Hardy really needs to workout or pass the character to someone else; his age is showing.  Harrelson and Harris' characters really didn't mesh, the half deaf cop never really fit into the story, we didn't hear enough from Carnage, and Venom's night out didn't actually go anywhere.  \r\n\r\nThe vibe of the movie felt clunky.\r\n\r\nI'll always like Venom.  But this was not particularly thrilling.  There is mixed opinion on which of the two movies is better.  I'll have to fall into the camp of those who liked the first Venom movie.  The second, more than not, simply let me down.

Add to this pretty dry mix the rather pointless character of Harrelson's childhood sweetheart \"Frances\" (Naomie Harris) alias \"the Scream\" (remember the symbiotes don't like fire of sound), with her own agenda against copper \"Mulligan\" (Stephen Graham) and the whole thing just boils down to a very good looking film - but one with a plot that was almost non-existent, and that robbed the formidably sarcastic \"Venom\" of much of the charm that made the original work. Come to think on it - Hardy hardly features at all. I didn't hate it - it has a pace that passes 90 minutes effortlessly enough, but sorry, I was really disappointed.","created_at":"2022-03-27T12:33:00.825Z","id":"6240597c706e56008bd25ee2","updated_at":"2022-03-27T12:33:00.825Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6240597c706e56008bd25ee2"},{"author":"Martha","author_details":{"name":"Martha","username":"MonsterMartha","avatar_path":null,"rating":6.0},"content":"Let me say this... It isn't a bad movie to watch at all.\r\n\r\nFelt more like an after thought of the previous film than it's own film. It becomes messy trying to hear Venom cause he talks so fast. Carnage was bad ass... His love interest felt tacked on and cliche. Did we need Michelle Williams back? Not really. The ending...

This is the second, the first dates from 2017.\r\n\r\nThe cyber punk style story is anything but linear, with plots  and sub plots. I have found this approach to story construction is typical, of a large number of Asian films and series. You really do need to pay attention or it can quickly become confusing. The tales overriding reflections on the horrors of war and the need to endure its aftermath, are universal.\r\n\r\nCharacterisations are well rounded and mostly relatable, with competent acting from the cast. That said, its worth keeping in mind the motivations and behaviours, of the characters might feel a little different and even quirky. This is to be expected, as this film mirrors Asian not Western attitudes and cultural norms.\r\n\r\nAction is plentiful and polished, with more than decent special effects. Certainly, this film is never going to bore action fans.\r\n\r\nIs there a downside? At times it did feel a little silly. Some  of the humour in particular, comes across as rather slapstick. That said, it could just be my cultural perspective and probably is, in truth. \r\n\r\nCharacterisations can be over the top at times but maybe that's just Manga? I don't know.\r\n\r\nI summary, can't comment on the integrity of the translation from comic/animation format to live character action. That said, as a non Manga purist, it really doesn't matter.I liked this film and look forward to the third instalment in the series.","created_at":"2022-08-29T21:55:45.800Z","id":"630d35e1924ce6007accfce7","updated_at":"2022-08-29T22:00:25.407Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630d35e1924ce6007accfce7"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1680579,"title":"Fullmetal

Thomas M. Wright manages to insert some visually interesting shots, relying mainly on the subtle, intimate performances of Joel Edgerton and Sean Harris to carry the story.\r\n\r\nHowever, the so-called mystery lacks actual intrigue and anything emotional to connect with the viewers, creating doubt as to whether the film would have benefited from a greater level of creativity without detracting from the realistic atmosphere employed by the filmmaker.\r\n\r\nRecommended only for fans of the subgenre.\"\r\n\r\nRating: C","created_at":"2022-10-26T15:48:01.975Z","id":"635956b12cefc20098643bed","updated_at":"2022-10-26T15:48:02.056Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/635956b12cefc20098643bed"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1638854,"title":"The Stranger","original_title":"The Stranger","plot_overview":"Two strangers strike up a conversation on a long journey.

You can probably assuage that fear though, because I went to see it with two people who had only seen _Black Panther_ at this point, and they both loved it, with minimal confusion.\r\n\r\nPersonally?

I'm so happy that Marvel is stepping up their game with their villains. For too long, MCU villains have been too bland and generic.

Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film, and if he failed as a character, the entire movie wouldn't have worked.

The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n\"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia.

you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThe 101 Dalmatians franchise is one of those Disney properties that is always broadcasted across all main television networks during holidays in my country, usually during Christmas. The live-action films of 1996 and 2000 are stored somewhere in my memory, even though I never really sat down and watched the movies all by myself. Cruella might just be another live-action film from the Mickey Mouse studio, but it's far from being yet another remake, much on the contrary. Just like the vast majority of the company's villains, Cruella de Vil (portrayed by Glenn Close in the previous installments) was even worse than the generic antagonist with cliche motivations that eventually every studio used and reused to exhaustion.\r\n\r\nBesides Cruella's greedy necessities, purely evil personality, and extreme vanity, this wicked character was driven by something completely unthinkable: skinning short-haired puppies to have more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur. Anyone with a conscience knows that Disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes, especially regarding this motivation in particular. How would a movie with a dog-killing protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful? Obviously, this hardcore motif no longer belongs to Emma Stone's Cruella's defining character traits, which might be a no-no for those viewers who are more protective of the original material, as if times and culture didn't change from decade to decade.\r\n\r\nSince the start of Disney's live-action remakes campaign, audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films. Some wish for a copy-paste version of the same story, while others desire a completely different take on the well-known narrative. However, the best experience - and the primary goal of these movies - is a mix of both: a version that keeps the essence and the message of the original while bringing something new and different to the table to justify its existence. Cruella isn't a remake but an origin(al) story based on a classic villain... And it's undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen this year until this day! I didn't expect to write an extensive review, but with so much to address, I know my thoughts will take a while to transcribe to this article.\r\n\r\nLet me start with some easy elements that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into \"deep analysis mode\". The costume design is indisputably the technical standout. The colorfully stunning dresses steal the show visually, but it's how it differentiates Estella and Cruella that Jenny Beavan shines in her job. Just from what Stone wears, the viewers can easily decipher what character she's playing. The differences between the glamorous, rich people that the Baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty, poor friends Estella meets at the beginning of the movie - Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) - is also accentuated through their wardrobes.\r\n\r\nThe extravagant parties are packed with Oscar-worthy costumes, but also with beautiful makeup & hair (Nadia Stacey) and absolutely ravishing production design (Fiona Crombie). Nicholas Britell's score carries little references to the music of the other installments, as does the film itself. Craig Gillespie doesn't hide the Easter Eggs spread throughout the runtime, of which some will definitely please the most avid fans. Technically, it's as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio, but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above. In a movie where even the black-and-white hair and clothes of Cruella pop off the screen, the CGI backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyper-realistic remake of The Lion King.\r\n\r\nCGI dogs are employed during most of the runtime, which is not only understandable but also commendable. Animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago. However, the VFX don't look good enough, causing the dogs - mainly the Dalmatians - to be an unintended distraction. In addition to this, a specific outdoor location that's quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark, fake background that just feels way too off. Finally, the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible CGI that will definitely leave the more \"logic-driven\" viewers stunned with disappointment. I consider this a nitpick, especially since it's not a film without silliness.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Cruella's success partially rests on Gillespie's tone balance. Jasper and Horace become the comic-relief characters, starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from. Now, some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun. However, Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's screenplay carries undeniable similarities to The Devil Wears Prada and the most recent Joker. Estella's life story is far from being a happy tale, and Cruella's rise even less. Overall, the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic, depressing, traumatic storyline is mostly well-handled, but there are a few moments where Gillespie lets it too loose, especially in the over-Disney-ish last fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nSo, let's address the two protagonists: Estella and Cruella. The comparisons with Joaquin Phoenix's take on Arthur Fleck / Joker are impossible to unsee. From the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation, Emma Stone's character follows a similar arc, but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems. Estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the self-centered, self-indulgent Baroness, which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business. The Baroness' despicable treatment of Estella brings the ruthless Cruella gradually back to life, eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little Estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living... without having to carry on extreme measures.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected, clever twist pretty much completes the protagonist's transformation, which genuinely caught me by surprise. I admit that I didn't have high hopes for this origin story. Nevertheless, the well-written screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain, offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations. While it's true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous Baroness, Cruella never truly becomes 100% that person. Honestly, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, but I don't think there's room for another film that wouldn't hurt the one we just got. So, there's just one more aspect to delve into: the cast's performances.\r\n\r\nJoel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves. Both share a compelling connection to Estella, one that I believe deserved a better conclusion. They become a family, living and stealing throughout their lives, but when Estella starts giving Cruella some screentime, a few issues arise within the trio. These problems are indeed approached and solved, but in a less dramatic manner than I hoped for. Fry is excellent as the more competent, rational Jasper, but Hauser never stops being extremely funny. The before-mentioned balance is rarely affected by the characters' comedic banter, which is something the actors also deserve credit for.\r\n\r\nEmma Thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography, interpreting the Baroness von Hellman. How can you make an extremely over-the-top character feel cartoonish yet strangely real? Someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world? Thompson takes her role, and the only reason why she doesn't steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other Emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain. With obvious references to Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, Thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene, making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Emma Stone manages to stay a level above everyone else. I firmly believe that she's one of the best actresses of her generation. Carrying one of the most expressive faces in Hollywood, Stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities. Without looking at the screen, any viewer will be able to know if she's talking as Estella or Cruella. Not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character, but the mannerisms alter as well. It would be a massive surprise if such an early Disney performance got an Oscar nomination, so her chances are obviously thin. However, if there was an award for Best Monologue, Stone would be a strong contender.\r\n\r\nI don't recall how many minutes it really is, but I can't forget that long, uncut take with Stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue. Switching between Estella and Cruella in the span of milliseconds, her micro-expressions elevate a heartfelt, character-defining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema. Stone gives not one but two impressive, attention-grabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a Cruella they can understand and even root for.\r\n\r\nCruella is not only one of 2021's biggest surprises, but it's also one of the best movies of the year so far. Despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative, Craig Gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin(al) story about one of Disney's classic villains. Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the Estella-Cruella transformation, giving her non-dog-killing, emotionally compelling motivations, a traumatic, depressing past, and an unexpected twist that will probably catch most viewers off-guard. With one of her best performances ever, Emma Stone delivers an award-worthy display, interpreting two personalities in impressive fashion, stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations. Technically, the distracting CGI in animals and some noticeable green-screen don't overcome the predictably Oscar-winning, stunning costume design, as well as the gorgeous makeup & hair, wonderful production design, and sweet score packed with excellent song choices. A character study that makes this one of Disney's best live-action films in the last couple of decades.\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2021-05-26T15:07:13.281Z","id":"60ae64210f2ae10057563b35","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:56.291Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60ae64210f2ae10057563b35"},{"author":"Mahnoor Khan","author_details":{"name":"Mahnoor Khan","username":"Mahnoor_Khan","avatar_path":"/wER6MfaKV3swJdjrvRHXwBQxBIw.png","rating":9.0},"content":"It is one of the best villain origin stories.

The background story of Cruella is brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is excellent and the costume designs deserve Oscar. Such beautiful costumes I get to see in this movie. The cinematography and direction are the best.\r\n\r\nCruella's character is quite similar to Joker and Harley Quinn but still, Cruella is much different from both the anti villains.\r\n\r\nShe is dark and became burned by her career and looking for revenge as well as popularity just like the joker. While she loves unique costumes, makeup, a hairstyle like Harley Quin.\r\n\r\nShe is cynical too like Harley and self-interested but then Harley is a good-hearted person who just made bad decisions while Cruella is sociopathic and a bit cruel as well.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun, surprising, and engaging movie.

The campiness of Emma Stone’s performance as the titular Cruella, Emma Thompson doing her best Meryl Streep in a The Devil Wears Prada impression, the fashion, the development of Anita Darling’s character (lovingly played by Kirby Howell-Baptiste). All of these things make _Cruella_ the perfect summer movie. It’s a film that doesn’t take a lot of brainpower to follow, and it leaves the audience feeling light and happy.

So when a director chooses to make a scary film that’s centered around the female experience, it better be daring and disruptive. Such is the case with “Run Sweetheart Run,” a wild, twisted tale of female empowerment that is as political as it is terrifying.\r\n\r\nAfter a bad breakup, hardworking single mother Cherie (Ella Balinska) is set up on a blind date with the handsome Ethan (Pilou Asbæk). He’s sophisticated, magnetic, and ever the charmer. When Cherie agrees to return to his house for an after-dinner nightcap, Ethan brutally attacks her. She manages to escape the grasp of this lethal predator, but only temporarily. Alone on the streets of Los Angeles with a torn dress covered in blood and without a cell phone or shoes, bystanders refuse to help because they assume she’s a junkie. But once the police finally arrive, it becomes clear that Ethan is very connected and everyone is against her. Turns out her date is a hunter, and he delights in spending the rest of the evening stalking his female prey.\r\n\r\nWriter – director Shana Feste has created a literal date from hell scenario. Cherie is already creeped out by an unsettling Uber ride on the way to her date, and things get worse from there. It’s a story that will resonate with many women, as Feste accurately captures what many single ladies would deem their worst nightmare. It raises the “what would I do in this situation?” question as the leading lady calls on all of her will, ingenuity, and intellect to survive.\r\n\r\nThis story confronts toxic masculinity head-on like an atomic bomb full of social and political horror. There is a not-so-subtle, chilling commentary about people of color, particularly when it comes to minority women who are assaulted. It’s repeated that “nobody cares” about women like Cherie because people like her don’t matter when they go missing — and their police cases are shuffled to the bottom of the pile.\r\n\r\nThe commentary on rape culture and gender politics is strong too, especially because Ethan is a dominant male who thinks he’s in control. He snarls how he must “keep girls like you in their place,” even blaming Cherie for his predatory behavior because she dressed too sexily for a first date.\r\n\r\nThe end result is violent and bloody, but Feste’s choice not to show the worst of the violence onscreen may disappoint hardcore fans of the genre. But it’s scarier because of what you don’t see than it being necessary to show a man brutally attacking a woman. The sounds alone are chilling, and it’s just as horrifying (if not more so) to hear the attacks rather than witness them.\r\n\r\nThe film takes a sobering walk along patriarchy and gender lines, but it evolves into an empowering tale of a strong, badass heroine who refuses to be a victim and fights back. The story is simple and not particularly memorable, but the themes are where this film shines. Everything, down to the smallest details, are steeped in a deeply critical and political view of modern society. In a moment of blink-or-you’ll-miss-it cleverness, the gritty landscape of L.A. is dotted with inappropriate, sexist billboards that convey the hurdles (and minor horrors) females face in everyday life.\r\n\r\n“Run Sweetheart Run” is a liberating, spirited, and inspiring thriller that will resonate with women everywhere. Power to the people, but especially the ladies.","created_at":"2020-03-27T01:34:25.044Z","id":"5e7d5821f794ad0015ef2972","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:35.788Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5e7d5821f794ad0015ef2972"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1538644,"title":"Run Sweetheart Run","original_title":"Run Sweetheart Run","plot_overview":"A woman runs for her life though the streets of Los Angeles after her blind date suddenly turns violent.","type":"movie","runtime_minutes":103,"year":2020,"end_year":null,"release_date":"2020-01-27","imdb_id":"tt8656686","tmdb_id":532870,"tmdb_type":"movie","genres":[17,11],"genre_names":["Horror","Thriller"],"user_rating":5.4,"critic_score":null,"us_rating":null,"poster":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/posters/01538644_poster_w185.jpg","backdrop":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/backdrops/01538644_bd_w780.jpg","original_language":"en","similar_titles":[1582360,1595955,1374263,1299858,196169,1619418,1109839,143016,152410,1472315,1340558,1435613,1422934,1615045,1590425,1383028,1143727,1566984,1160925,1381106,1222163,1358579,1397954,1595835,1642270],"networks":null,"network_names":[],"relevance_percentile":95.71,"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLoEZnJ2uO0","trailer_thumbnail":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/video_thumbnails/747875_pthumbnail_320.jpg","sources":[{"source_id":26,"name":"Amazon Prime","type":"sub","region":"US","ios_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","android_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","web_url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.2412cdf8-3b30-4cab-a51f-728f303cd33d?&autoplay=1","format":"HD","price":null,"seasons":null,"episodes":null}]}],[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/gJESrIalQkXe7bh9ckyQvgCSlhq.jpg","belongs_to_collection":null,"budget":0,"genres":[{"id":16,"name":"Animation"},{"id":12,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":10751,"name":"Family"},{"id":14,"name":"Fantasy"},{"id":35,"name":"Comedy"}],"homepage":"http://www.netflix.com/title/80178603","id":560052,"imdb_id":"tt9288748","original_language":"en","original_title":"My Father's Dragon","overview":"Struggling to cope after a move to the city with his mother, Elmer runs away in search of Wild Island and a young dragon who waits to be rescued.

A young prince \"Amleth\" (Oscar Novak who later morphs into an effective Alexander Skarsgård) witnesses the murder of his father \"King Aurvandil\" (Ethan Hawke) and the capture of his mother \"Gudrún\" (Nicole Kidman) by his treacherous uncle \"Fjölnir\" (Claes Bang). Lucky to escape with his life, he escapes to the land of the Rus where he is soon a capable and powerful warrior. When he learns that the traitor was, himself, deposed and now lives in the inhospitable Iceland, he decides to impersonate one of a group of slaves being sent to his farm so as to wreak his revenge. There are a few twists to the otherwise largely predictable plot - he meets the enigmatic \"Olga\" (Anya Taylor-Joy) and comes into possession of a deadly sword that can only be drawn at night; but what really makes this stand out is the gritty, dark and enthralling production. The headlines actors actually feature pretty sparingly, though we get a little more Kidman towards the end, and that's no bad thing. It leaves us to enjoy a storyline that draws heavily on the compelling Norse mythology. Not just of Odin, Freya, Valhallah and the like, but of the whole cult of nature; of animalistic behaviour amongst man and beast alike. It draws on a symbiotic relationship with the environment that tests the faith of pagan and Christian alike. It is brutal, but somehow not gratuitous. That's how man treated man; women were little better than breeding chattels and children were even further down the food chain. Robert Eggers has put much more meat on the bones than almost any similar depiction from this hugely rich and enthralling vein of mythology that mixes fact, fiction, fantasy, mysticism and fear very well. It's 2¼ of well paced adventure that looks stunning on a big screen and is well worth a watch there before it loses much of it's grand scale potency on a telly.","created_at":"2022-04-18T10:21:25.684Z","id":"625d3ba5229ae2321982ffcc","updated_at":"2022-04-18T10:26:34.769Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/625d3ba5229ae2321982ffcc"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"It took me a little while to get into it, but by its conclusion <em>'The Northman'</em> had fully entertained me. Great film!\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I'm delighted that I did indeed enjoy this film as my only previous experience of director Robert Eggers was the - in my opinion, and apparently my opinion only! - severely unsatisfying <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lighthouse-2019/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Lighthouse</a>'</em>. It's unmistakable that this 2022 flick is made by the same person, but happily the outcome is far greater.\r\n\r\nThe cast are top notch. Alexander Skarsgård and Anya Taylor-Joy are the two standouts, the latter of which is doing big things lately; she is excellent in the most recent season of television show <em>'Peaky Blinders'</em>, fwiw. Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke and Nicole Kidman are all very good. Willem Dafoe too, naturally.\r\n\r\nThe story is super absorbing, even early on when I was a tad unsure I was still very invested in what was happening onscreen. The dialogue is a big reason for that, as is the thumping score. At times it can feel like it might become too talky and full of itself in regards to its own mythology and all that, though thankfully it never strays into those realms. It also delivers plenty of action, alongside some good ol' violence as well - the ending is quality in that regard, among other reasons too.\r\n\r\nGo watch!","created_at":"2022-04-27T17:40:51.300Z","id":"626980231f98d100664653ea","updated_at":"2022-04-27T17:40:51.300Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/626980231f98d100664653ea"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"_The Northman_ is a bloody and ferocious battle cry of a revenge film.

I didn't care for any of them. Story was a typical vengeance story, nothing special or unique and the movie itself was very slow, lacking action and I almost fell a sleep. At first it seemed a realistic movie, but then they started putting supernatural things, so it wasn't realistic, but wasn't a typical unrealistic movie (like Marvel and DC) either. It was just a poor attempt of mixed jumble.

It’s a masterpiece of photography and cinematography. And probably it’s the closest film about the Vikings era and culture. Is it perfect? Almost. But we will tell you more in our analysis. - **The Story** - In the North Atlantic of the 895 a.d., a story of betrayals and revenge happened. The protagonist is a little prince, Amleth, who will live his existence in the shadow of vengeance. His life's goal is to fulfil his desire to take back what someone else stole from him: a father, a mother and a kingdom. But, unfortunately, pain and revenge can transform a boy into a brutal wolve. Therefore, Amleth begins his journey, guided by Odin, because justice is what moves our God's desires. But what happened to Amleth? Where is this journey lead him?

me that Indian movies apparently should just be ignored, as ratings apparently tell you absolutely nothing about the quality of a film.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the worst acting I've ever seen - Plan 9 from Outer Space included - with post-production dubbed voices to boot! Add to that the most cringey, cartoonish pathetic storyline, and you're seriously wondering if this is all a joke. No, SERIOUSLY wondering.\r\n\r\nI considered I might keep watching for the laughs (I was laughing from the very first scene with the lip surgery receiving evil white woman sitting in the jungle in the 1920s surrounded by kneeling indigenous worshippers and a terribly-dubbed studio recording of a little girl singing, with the girl not even remote knowing the lyrics and making all the wrong mouth movements to pretend it's actually her doing the singing). But then I realized at 3h5m, the cringey OMG-it's-so-bad-it's-funny laughs definitely wouldn't last that long.\r\n\r\nHoly graboid on a blind horse, Batman, this is so bad!\r\n\r\nNo more Indian movies for me. Lesson learned.","created_at":"2022-07-25T16:49:53.043Z","id":"62dec9b1955c65004c937529","updated_at":"2022-07-25T16:49:53.146Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62dec9b1955c65004c937529"},{"author":"kamaravichow","author_details":{"name":"","username":"kamaravichow","avatar_path":"/d6DzC5WGJTE4DSZUyqAmPaCBuNQ.png","rating":10.0},"content":"The Cinemark near me has started to show Indian movies. Not feeling like sitting home tonight, I decided to catch this one, and luck was with me.\r\n\r\nMy image of Indian movies, I confess, was that they were mostly musicals centering around a love story involving a very beautiful young woman and a very handsome young man, with lots of elaborate, high-energy dance numbers to keep things going.\r\n\r\nThere is a love story here, but it's not the focus of the film. There are also a few large and very impressive dance numbers, but only a few. (The men's dancing, extremely athletic, astounded me.)\r\n\r\nRather, this movie focuses on the story of two young men in 1920s India who, each in his own way, are fighting against the English occupiers.\r\n\r\nThe English are portrayed as inhuman monsters. Very often, they made me think of the worst atrocities committed by the Germans in France during World War II, or the most rabid racists in the American South. The first time we see the two male leads dancing, a link is indeed made between the Indians and what appear to be Black American musicians.\r\n\r\nEvery time the Indians manage to take revenge on the English for their inhuman abuse of the Indians, you cheer - but at times I wondered if I would have cheered watching a parallel movie about Blacks taking revenge on white racists who had mistreated them in the American South, especially if I had been in a movie theater where, like tonight, I was the only audience member who did not belong to the oppressed population. Imagine Spike Lee, for example, able to make a movie in which he did not have to worry about selling tickets to whites as well as Blacks, and you have some idea of how anti-British colonials this movie is. It is the difference between a society in which the oppressor was a small minority of the population vs. Here, where Blacks are a minority of the American population. I don't want to push this comparison too far. The movie only makes the connection in one scene. But this is very definitely a movie that focuses on the story of a brutally oppressed people seeking freedom from an inhuman oppressor, rather than just a series of dance numbers.\r\n\r\nI don't speak any of the Indian languages used in the movie, but I had no problem following what was going on with the subtitles, which were almost always easy to read. I'm sure there were cultural references I didn't catch, however, especially at the end in the final big dance number, which seemed to be presenting India as a nation of different regions and cultures all united in one.\r\n\r\nThe director and cinematographer definitely deserve praise. There was one very striking visual image after the next, especially during the battle scenes. Ram Charan, dressed as a \"native warrior\"-if that term means anything anymore-flying through flames was breathtaking.\r\n\r\nSo, if you've even been curious about Indian movies, give this one a try.

The sword fights and martial arts had some inventive moments with fresh new techniques and finishing moves that I hadn’t seen before. The stunt work was almost to the level of John Wick, which was unexpected for a straight-to-streaming film and very appreciated. Even though the movie was very predictable, and I had seen many other films like it before, The Princess is still entertaining and is better than reviews imply. Any action fan that loves the Die Hard, Con Air, Passenger 57 type movies will enjoy The Princess’s medieval, sword fighting, fantasy spin on the genre.","created_at":"2022-09-28T20:07:13.504Z","id":"6334a971764841007d2e46dd","updated_at":"2022-09-28T20:07:13.578Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6334a971764841007d2e46dd"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1621175,"title":"The Princess","original_title":"The Princess","plot_overview":"A beautiful, strong-willed young royal refuses to wed the cruel sociopath to whom she is betrothed and is kidnapped and locked in a remote tower of her father’s castle.

Luca is warned not to go on the surface and to avoid humans at all costs by his parents.\r\n\r\nWhen a rebellious Sea Monster named Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer); happens upon Luca and gets him to the surface; Luca discovers that he and Alberto appear as human boys when their skin is no longer wet.\r\n\r\nFascinated by the rebellious life Alberto leads and amazed by what he sees upon his brief land excursions; Luca looks for new ways to find time on the surface which leads to him being more and more deceptive to his parents.\r\n\r\nIn time Luca and Alberto head to the village and meet a spunky local girl named Giulia (Emma Berman); who is on a break from school and longs to win a local race in order to get back at the reigning champion and bully.\r\n\r\nLuca and Alberto see the race as a chance to win money to buy their own Vespa which they see as the key to exploring the surface world which sets a chain of events into motion as their two worlds are about to collide leading up to the race.\r\n\r\nThe film is visually appealing, but the story for me dragged and did not have the spark and heart that have made countless PIXAR films enduring classics. While the characters were fine; they did not have the appeal or charisma that I have come to expect with the PIXAR brand.\r\n\r\nThere have been reports that after “SOUL” was moved from a theatrical release to streaming during the Pandemic that some at PIXAR were upset with the decision to make “Luca” a streaming option.  My take is that it was 100% the correct decision as while it is an entertaining film; it is not one that is likely to light up the Box Office and is better suited for a streaming debut.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue with “Luca” is that coming from a studio with such a long line of classics; it fails to reach the levels previously set and while entertaining comes up lacking.\r\n\r\n3 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-06-16T16:08:48.678Z","id":"60ca22102fccee003fb40e51","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:56.937Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60ca22102fccee003fb40e51"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/luca-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Luca follows the studio's formulas of success closely without taking any unique detours, but it still tells a compelling story with relatable characters that gets to the viewers' heartstrings. From the detailed animation that makes the Italian coast look realistically astonishing to Dan Romer's rich score that hits all the right notes, without forgetting the outstanding voice work, every Pixar's trademark technical attribute is present in an admittedly less complex, unsurprising narrative. Enrico Casarosa takes Jesse Andrews and Mike Jones' light screenplay through a generic structure, where the \"feeling/being different\" theme is efficiently developed but closed in an underwhelming manner. Nevertheless, predictability means nothing in a movie where fully-developed characters spend the summer creating genuine friendships with an impactful emotional weight that might induce a couple of tears in the last few powerful minutes. It's not my favorite Pixar flick, but it's definitely a good film that I wholeheartedly recommend watching.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2021-06-16T16:14:09.422Z","id":"60ca235142d8a50056d9ec6f","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:56.941Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60ca235142d8a50056d9ec6f"},{"author":"Kamurai","author_details":{"name":"Kamurai","username":"Kamurai","avatar_path":"/sKeC7qZLAKreuwxH4x6U3mN7Aa8.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is full of fun and child-like wonder, with a surprising edge to it as there is an usual amount of violence directly related to the main characters.\r\n\r\nThis has a very wholesome feel to it as it has the romantic aspect of searching for new frontiers and adventures, but not necessarily for romantic relationships.\r\n\r\nThe story does a good job of pacing out the events of the movie allowing for each aspect to take the focus it needs.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a movie about a triatholon, it's a better story about freedom and acceptance.","created_at":"2021-06-21T00:05:16.003Z","id":"60cfd7bb43d9b10057a55fd3","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:57.105Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60cfd7bb43d9b10057a55fd3"},{"author":"badelf","author_details":{"name":"","username":"badelf","avatar_path":null,"rating":5.0},"content":"Meh.

Most of the action is bogged down by sloppy editing where a complete absence of proper lighting ruins whatever positives the film had going for it. The talented cast does what they can with their roles, but it’s not enough to make the film entertaining. Ana de Armas is mostly forgettable apart from shooting tranquilizer darts in guy’s butts and firing a rocket launcher a few times. Tedious and sluggish with punches and kicks and kills that barely satisfy, _The Gray Man_ is a dead on arrival action thriller that squanders potential almost as often as Ryan Gosling chews gum.\r\n\r\n**Full Review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Gray-Man-2022-The-Yawn-Ultimatum","created_at":"2022-07-15T00:56:23.329Z","id":"62d0bb3762fcd3005545b959","updated_at":"2022-07-15T00:56:23.329Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62d0bb3762fcd3005545b959"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"MORE SPOILER-FREE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/\r\n\r\n\"The Gray Man holds the energetic, over-the-top, explosive action from the Russo Brothers, which should be enough to entertain the vast majority of the audience throughout the admittedly generic, predictable screenplay.

We start with a young man being released from prison by \"Fitzroy\" (Tommy Lee Jones) so he can join an elite CIA hit squad. Named \"Six\" (Gosling), his first mission is straight out of the \"Mechanic\" (2011) only it's an erstwhile colleague that he is sent to eradicate. A task that proves remarkably simple but is accomplished not before, luckily for us, he is given a micro chip that illustrates his new boss \"Carmichael\" (an underwhelming Regé-Jean Page) is about as crooked as the day is long. There now ensues a series of long \"John Wick\" style combat scenes as try as this hugely well equipped CIA operation does, it simply cannot capture \"Six\". Desperate times call for desperate measures so \"Hansen\" (Evans) is drafted in to finally do the business by kidnapping the easily accessible niece of the now retired TLJ, and using her as leverage he tries a different tack. Wholesale slaughter follows and along the way some lovely buildings in Prague and Croatia become neat piles of rubble; the local citizens are dropping like flies sending those in the CIA PR department into spasms... Well you get the gist. The always over-rated Ana de Armas sports quite a colourful suit at the start, but as usual her contributions are pretty unimpressive; TLJ is nowhere near his best and the thing lurches on towards a really inevitable conclusion that stretched out the thinnest of plots and showed a really disconcerting image of a CIA completely out of control, running rampage - and that scenario isn't remotely plausible. There is plenty of car-chasing, gunfights and pyrotechnic displays but that's nowhere near enough to compensate for a pretty unremarkable script and an amalgam of stories we have seen done better elsewhere, many times before. That said, if you get a chance to see it during it's limited cinema run then I'd give it a go. On television this is just subscription fodder with A-list cows that you will instantly forget.","created_at":"2022-07-22T06:06:54.878Z","id":"62da3e7e90dde0011085fdce","updated_at":"2022-07-22T06:06:54.991Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62da3e7e90dde0011085fdce"},{"author":"the_blueeyes","author_details":{"name":"","username":"the_blueeyes","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/507b290a19caa67faefce009d1521c31.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"Seing this as another run to the mill Netflix release should not keep your hopes up. Netflix is where mediocre goes to congreate to the masses.\r\nWe have another spy action movie amongst us. Last one before this was Kate, that was another bland action-spy movie.\r\nThis offers absolutely NOTHING new to the table. We seen every trick this movie offer before. Over-skilled agents. Clever coreographed fight scenes, Trick tactics, agents with no names, An agency who elimintaes their own agents, expendable kill teams, plenty conspiracies and tons of action.\r\nBut i have to say i enjoy Gosling alone in this one. He plays it cool. Its  just shame that he is backed up with a script littered with clichés from start to end.\r\nWe also have Ana De Armas who is fast becoming the new Tom Holland that appears everywhere. An actress that is milked trought the Hollywood system and spewed out to never be heard of again some day.\r\nBut the movie is for sure a worthy popcorn flick with no expetations to give.

The outrageous action and super cheesy dialogue try to take itself as a serious spy movie. Don’t get me wrong-it’s not a bad movie. The fight choreography is pretty good, and the Gray Man boasts an impressive A-list cast. It is a decent generic action flick. But the goofiness of Chris Evans’ villain was almost at Batman & Robin levels. I really wanted to rate this movie a little higher (like a 3.5 of 5 or 7 of 10), but it just falls short.","created_at":"2022-08-19T23:10:51.996Z","id":"6300187b33a376007a43e5eb","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:17:04.433Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6300187b33a376007a43e5eb"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":6}},{"id":1616014,"title":"The Gray Man","original_title":"The Gray Man","plot_overview":"When a shadowy CIA agent uncovers damning agency secrets, he's hunted across the globe by a sociopathic rogue operative who's put a bounty on his head.","type":"movie","runtime_minutes":128,"year":2022,"end_year":null,"release_date":"2022-07-13","imdb_id":"tt1649418","tmdb_id":725201,"tmdb_type":"movie","genres":[1,17],"genre_names":["Action","Thriller"],"user_rating":7.3,"critic_score":48,"us_rating":"PG-13","poster":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/posters/01616014_poster_w185.jpg","backdrop":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/backdrops/01616014_bd_w780.jpg","original_language":"en","similar_titles":[169544,1190302,1505741,1188728,1390755,1381051,1357037,1146503,1210029,166940,1384418,1404391,1414961,1389687,1181312,1114000,1277986,1195868,1185031,1369865,1352225,1332032,1350599,168880,1436657],"networks":null,"network_names":[],"relevance_percentile":99.99,"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmllggGO4pM","trailer_thumbnail":"https://cdn.watchmode.com/video_thumbnails/730841_pthumbnail_320.jpg","sources":[{"source_id":203,"name":"Netflix","type":"sub","region":"US","ios_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","android_url":"Deeplinks available for paid plans only.","web_url":"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81160697","format":"HD","price":null,"seasons":null,"episodes":null}]}],[{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/1Ds7xy7ILo8u2WWxdnkJth1jQVT.jpg","belongs_to_collection":null,"budget":74000000,"genres":[{"id":28,"name":"Action"},{"id":12,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":35,"name":"Comedy"}],"homepage":"https://www.thelostcity.movie/","id":752623,"imdb_id":"tt13320622","original_language":"en","original_title":"The Lost City","overview":"Reclusive author Loretta Sage writes about exotic places in her popular adventure novels that feature a handsome cover model named Alan.

While there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film, a large percentage of them missed the mark completely. There were scenes that had me laughing aloud and others that were a little cringe at times, so the humor levels will for sure vary per viewer. The overall plot was somewhat standard but entertaining enough as comedy plots are concerned. The beginning starts off strong and then slowly fades as the plot becomes more unbelievable. The acting is excellent, as it should be with this type of star power. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum had spectacular comedic chemistry and bounced off each other nicely. Daniel Radcliffe’s over the top villain antics were fairly decent as well, nothing groundbreaking. Brad Pitt was a standout, and I wish we saw more of him in this film, but his scenes by far were the most memorable. Even though this movie has its ups and downs, it understands what it is, and does not take itself seriously. This translates to the audience not taking it seriously as well, which results in a fairly fun viewing experience.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Decent_","created_at":"2022-07-07T02:57:13.322Z","id":"62c64b898ec4ab01a93f6240","updated_at":"2022-07-15T15:12:05.311Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62c64b898ec4ab01a93f6240"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"It was... okay.

The movie basically revolves around Channing Tatum’s hilarious reaction to every peril and danger. Sandra Bullock charms as always, and Daniel Radcliffe’s kooky villain entertains but the best part of the film is Brad Pitt’s over-the-top hero. His character is a gut-busting foil to Tatum’s attempts to impress Sandra Bullock. The Lost City has plenty of funny moments and laughs but feels overly familiar like I have seen it all in other movies. I enjoyed The Lost City and recommend it, but I wish it did more to feel unique than rely on Tatum’s wacky antics and Pitt’s uproarious cameo.","created_at":"2022-10-08T00:30:18.906Z","id":"6340c49a7eb5f2008337b502","updated_at":"2022-10-08T00:30:18.994Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6340c49a7eb5f2008337b502"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":6},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Extended Preview","key":"lWcD2icgoGs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2022-05-10T18:59:48.000Z","id":"627aecee32cc2b006683e407"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Official Trailer","key":"5f9VcZqxFO4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2021-12-16T14:05:25.000Z","id":"61bb4afd6a300b001d91146f"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer","key":"awHyqJv3WKE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2021-12-16T14:05:12.000Z","id":"61bb5102873f000042b8c0ac"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1620816,"title":"The Lost City","original_title":"The Lost City","plot_overview":"Reclusive author Loretta Sage writes about exotic places in her popular adventure novels that feature a handsome cover model named Alan.

SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/dog-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Dog may be unimaginative and unsurprising, but it still offers a simple, lovely story, boasting enough authenticity and genuine emotion to captivate any viewer. Bearing in mind the directorial debuts of Channing Tatum and Reid Carolin, it's worth highlighting the lack of extreme dramatizations or overly sophisticated shots, which helped keep the narrative quite natural.\r\n\r\nDespite an odd plot point or two, Briggs and Lulu share emotionally impactful interactions that will generate a lot of smiles, a few laughs, and, who knows, a tear or two - Thomas Newman's fantastic score will surely cause that.\r\n\r\nI couldn't recommend this film more for anyone who considers their pet as their best friend.\"\r\n\r\nRating:

Going into this film, I thought I had a pretty good indication of how this was going to go down and was ready for a fun cheesy horror film that follow a pretty generic pattern, but boy was I wrong. Almost the entirety of the trailer was just the first act, and it left me seriously stumped at where this movie was going.\r\nThat sense of unknown really added to the thick tension that this movie brought throughout. There is a paranoia that occurs with both the audience and the main character. You never know who to trust, even if they give you all the indications that they are trustworthy.\r\n\r\nIn today's horror cinema, it is rare to see a movie so reliant on building tension rather than just jump scares galore. Not to say that this film does not have any jump scares, but they are there to enhance and bring a crescendo to the long scenes of tension and dread.\r\n\r\nOverall, the acting was brilliant. Georgina Campbell was fantastic. Bill Skarsgård was a bit awkward at times, but I do think that was by choice, as his actor was a kind awkward sweetheart. Justin Long stole the show. His character added a bit of lightness and someone who the audience can really root against.\r\nThe movie does slightly fall of the rails in the third act, it does not take away from the experience that is Barbarian. In fact, I think it almost enhances the film as something truly unique.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _87%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_","created_at":"2022-10-14T17:58:36.234Z","id":"6349a34c021cee007dc09209","updated_at":"2022-10-14T17:58:36.310Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6349a34c021cee007dc09209"},{"author":"MovieGuys","author_details":{"name":"","username":"MovieGuys","avatar_path":null,"rating":4.0},"content":"I like Justin Long, he was fantastic in Jeepers Creepers but Barbarian is uninspiring, to say the least. Not that that is the fault of the actors.\r\n\r\nWithout giving too much away, Barbarian feels a little like The Hills Have Eyes, meets Psycho, meets Quasimodo. The problem here is the scripting and handling. Its takes far too long for this story to get off the ground, it has weird, nonsensical plot holes and the reveal comes far to early. \r\n\r\nWhats left almost feels like a second film. It leaves only a reiteration of the essential earlier plot line with a few wrinkles, as the film moves towards its rather icky, conclusion.\r\n\r\nOf course, any sense of fear and tension, built up subtly in the first part of the film, is dissipated too. You know what's coming.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this film feels like it borrows from other horror flicks, in the worst possible way, leading to a disjointed but predictable viewing experience that's neither all that scary or even terribly interesting. The only thing propping it up, is the acting, which is of a high standard. Yet, as I've said more times than I can count, that on its own, is not enough.","created_at":"2022-10-26T00:26:56.139Z","id":"63587ed015959f0082a88367","updated_at":"2022-10-26T05:44:55.158Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63587ed015959f0082a88367"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"**While for many horror fans, Barbarian might be compelling and unique, I found it decent but more strange and uncomfortable than scary and not as remarkable as others seem to think.**\r\n\r\nBarbarian had heavy hype and big expectations before I checked it out. And while it didn’t blow my mind, I can see why many film aficionados would rate it more highly. It had a fresh Jordan Peele-type feel to a story that has been done many times before. I enjoyed the different stories coming together and the obvious nods to tropes of people ignoring clearly dangerous situations and red flags. However, while it had some fun elements, I wasn’t as impressed as many reviews suggested I should be. Definitely not a bad movie by any means, but some of the horror is just strange, and the creature is so bizarre that it’s less scary and more awkward at times.","created_at":"2022-10-27T21:53:56.875Z","id":"635afdf435c30a0079ea312d","updated_at":"2022-10-27T21:53:56.946Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/635afdf435c30a0079ea312d"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/barbarian-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Barbarian deserves all the hype it received so far!

Both are meant to be there - some dodgy booking admin - and so after a bit of a shaky start, and a bottle of red, they agree to share for the night. Next morning, on the hunt for some toilet tissue, she encounters a secret room in the basement that looks like it's been used for nefarious purposes. When her new friend comes home, he goes exploring and next thing, we discover a network of tunnels inhabited by... To be fair to auteur Zach Cregger, there is quite am impactful degree of claustrophobic horror to this but I am afraid I wasn't convinced - right from the start - with the plausibility of the whole thing. Whom, in their right mind, would discover what she does and then go off exploring, on their own, without taking some fairly elementary precautions? The drama and peril here is sort of forced upon us despite any natural alarm bells we might have saying \"I don't think so\". Anyway, it turns out that \"AJ\" (Justin Long) owns the house and when he turns up to find it still bestrewn with their luggage, he joins in the hunt in the tunnels and the pace hots up a little as escape becomes the imperative against a foe who makes \"Gollum\" look like Claudia Schiffer. It is quite a watchable affair, I did quite enjoy it, but I struggled with the realism of the scenarios and maybe just because I'm a scaredy cat, I wasn't ever really persuaded! Fun, though - and certainly at the better end of the recent releases in this often underwhelming genre.","created_at":"2022-11-03T08:45:29.217Z","id":"63637fa92b21080081e2c219","updated_at":"2022-11-03T08:45:29.322Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63637fa92b21080081e2c219"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":5}},{"id":1650358,"title":"Barbarian","original_title":"Barbarian","plot_overview":"In town for a job interview, a young woman arrives at her Airbnb late at night only to find that it has been mistakenly double-booked and a strange man is already staying there.

While the first film in 1995 was a decent hit; the follow-up in 1997 disappointed fans who had grown weary of the PG-13 take on the series.\r\n\r\nSubsequent efforts such as the 2011 television series also left fans wanting more; especially since the game series had become even more graphic and violent.\r\n\r\nAn animated film released in 2020 gave fans a taste of what they wanted as it featured graphical violence which many fans believed was essential to properly catch the spirit and action of the series.\r\n\r\nThe latest offering in the series “Mortal Kombat”; reboots the cinematic universe and gives fans the intense, brutal, and graphic violence that they have demanded. The film keeps the basic premise that the Outworld realm has won nine tournaments in a row, and based on the ancient laws; one more victory would allow them to take control of the Earth.\r\n\r\nRaiden the Thunder God (Tadanobu Asano); who has been tasked with protecting Earth looks to assemble and train a band of champions to save Earth. Naturally, this is not going to be easy as Shang Tsung (Chin Han); is not willing to follow the rules of the tournament and dispatches his top fighter (Sub Zero (Joe Taslim) to dispatch the champions of Earth before the tournament in a clear violation of the rules in order to ensure total victory.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is solid and very graphic action which contains gore and brutality on a level that almost kept the film from earning an R-rating. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there were some great recreations of classic moves by characters from the game series which were really well utilized and did not seem like gratuitous pandering.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot is fairly simplistic and does not deviate greatly from the source material; it does give a larger backstory to the universe. It was really enjoyable to see many nods to the franchise throughout both subtle and overt and while some characters were glaringly absent which was a surprise; the characters that were included were really solid to see and the door was wide open for their inclusion at a later date.\r\n\r\nWhile the cast does not contain any star power in terms of what Western audiences might expect from a major studio release; the ensemble works well and do a great job in bringing their characters to life.\r\n\r\nThe film leaves sequels wide open and teases a character that in my opinion was a glaring omission from the film. That being said; “Mortal Kombat” gives fans a solid adaptation that does not shy away from gore and violence and gives fans the cinematic experience that they have wanted.\r\n\r\n3.5 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-04-22T23:16:21.703Z","id":"608203c52b8a430029d0a07d","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:54.738Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/608203c52b8a430029d0a07d"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nEven though I consider myself somewhat of a gamer, I was never the biggest fan of the Mortal Kombat games, probably because I never really knew how to play them. Besides occasional visits to my neighbor's house to play several games on his PlayStation 1 (or 2?), I've only played this game on the nostalgic arcade machines that gave me incredible joy when I was younger. In all honesty, I don't exactly remember if I watched the previous film adaptations of the popular franchise, but I do know that both didn't receive the best feedback from critics and audiences, especially the 1997's flick. Therefore, I went to the theater - first time in over four months - with no real expectations. I just hoped the action would compensate for the predictably flawed screenplay.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm surprised at how much I actually had fun with this movie. Considering this is Simon McQuoid's feature directorial debut, as well as Greg Russo's first screenplay credit, my hopes rested on Dave Callaham's previous works (Wonder Woman 1984, Zombieland: Double Tap) and on the gory, violent action sequences. The latter component is the best element in the entire film, which will definitely leave the viewers in search of action-heavy entertainment satisfied. The opening sequence shows the merciless brutality of each fight through phenomenal stunt work (Hiroyuki Sanada is impressively talented), long takes with exceptional choreography, and a shocking amount of blood - something quite characteristic of the game franchise.\r\n\r\nThe only negative aspect about this opening is the fact that no other action scene surpasses it, which doesn't mean that the rest of the battles fail to live up to the expectations of the most avid fans. Despite a few shaky, roughly edited scenes, the vast majority of the fights are easy to follow and feature jaw-dropping moments, such as the \"Fatality!\" finishing moves. McQuoid and his team of writers try to make the movie understandable and exciting to everyone, but if there's a chance of placing a reference, an Easter Egg, or something alike, they proudly and unrestrainedly present it to the audience, which will trigger the most hardcore fans to let go of a resounding, adrenaline-fueled \"YEAH!\".\r\n\r\nI admit that I didn't expect the film to deliver those epic announcements from the game. From \"Flawless Victory!\" to \"Fatality!\", without forgetting the classic \"Fight!\", I did smile during these moments, where the actors actually change the tone of their voice to mimic the famous one-liners. Is it extraordinarily cheesy and over-the-top? Of course. Would any fan want it any other way? It might be a tad too much for some viewers, but I have to compliment McQuoid for fully committing to this adaptation. There's no ounce of shame, regret, or restraint. It's a movie made with a passionate public in mind, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to every single fan of the games.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe people will end up liking or disliking this film based on how much the action compensates for the lack of a compelling story, which is something even the most enthusiastic fans are probably anticipating as well. From a couple of nonsensical narrative decisions to hollow, uninteresting characters, the screenplay is solely focused on explaining everything surrounding Mortal Kombat - Earthworld, Outworld, champions, stakes, rules of the tournament - through lazy yet admittedly efficient exposition scenes. The characters could have been better developed, and the actors are far from being completely convincing. However, no one will enter the theater or click \"play\" on HBO Max expecting to witness an Oscar-worthy story...\r\n\r\nMortal Kombat is a surprisingly decent adaptation of the popular franchise, which will leave the most hardcore fans quite satisfied. For viewers with no experience or knowledge about the games, it could be a tough watch. However, if all the audience seeks is action-heavy entertainment, then Simon McQuoid's directorial debut fulfills the more reasonable expectations. Packed with references that even the least avid gamers will recognize, the fighting scenes are mostly well-filmed and quite energetic, focusing more on the gruesome, bloody, jaw-dropping Fatalities. Despite the opening sequence being the peak of great action, there are a couple of moments that could be compared to some parts of that epic start. Story-wise, Greg Russo and Dave Callaham's screenplay is as flawed as expected, possessing ridiculous developments and an abundance of dull exposition scenes, but it's the underwhelming use of a few interesting characters that negatively impacts the movie the most. In the end, I definitely recommend it to fans of the franchise, who will surely appreciate this film a lot more than myself.\r\n\r\nRating: B-","created_at":"2021-04-24T20:23:48.438Z","id":"60847e545c3247007764906c","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:54.784Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60847e545c3247007764906c"},{"author":"sykobanana","author_details":{"name":"","username":"sykobanana","avatar_path":"/j2KpvD880J95lqf3ct4u1MmWZhE.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"I liked this more than I should have.  \r\n\r\nI have tried the games, but am not into the fighting genre of games (although the Injustice series grabbed me for its story).

I usually don't like Sonya Blade but this movie made me like her. I don't like Liu Kang I never will so it didn't much matter who they cast in that role because that character to me is too generic. I did not care one way or another for Kung Lao or Kano. The guy playing Jax has been the best Jax so far. I hate how they made Milenna look in this one and it just didn't suit the purpose of what her character really is. Goro felt copied and pasted from the original film.\r\n\r\nAll in all this could have been much better but I doubt we get to see anything past this due to how generic and unfeeling this film actually felt. Sad excuse for a Mortal Kombat reboot.","created_at":"2022-07-26T08:32:46.806Z","id":"62dfa6ae1dbc88067315f7f6","updated_at":"2022-07-26T14:18:19.944Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62dfa6ae1dbc88067315f7f6"},{"author":"JPRetana","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPRetana","avatar_path":"/eYudFTVvIpCweDVQEl878whalTy.jpg","rating":1.0},"content":"Mortal Kombat is not just too long for a movie based on a fighting video game; it’s actually too dumb to even be a movie based on a fighting video game. On the one hand it does a Resident Evil, introducing a new character and making him the hero, instead of giving this role to an already established character – preferably one that is, you know, popular among the franchise’s fan base.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other hand, it dips into the same old MK well, kicking off with the Hanzo Hasashi Family Massacre – Kombat’s equivalent of the biblical Massacre of the Innocents. Only last year the animated Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge covered the exact same ground, and did it a lot better. The intertitle that follows the prologue confirms that we are not about to see anything new (Earthrealm blahblahblah Tournament blahblahblah Outworld blahblahblah).\r\n\r\nMK21 contains exactly (sub)zero surprises. The first time we see Jax, we know he is going to lose his original arms and have them replaced with cybernetic prosthetics (the only surprising thing about this is that the character's first replacement arms are quite underwhelming. Jax eventually gets something more in line with what we’re used to; the question is, why does the movie do in three steps what it should do in two?). Similarly, Kano's true, treacherous nature is no secret.\r\n\r\nWe already know all this. We know it like the backs of our hands. If we don't know it from playing the game, we know it from watching the 1995 movie – speaking of which, MK95 is 10 minutes shorter (it wasted little time with pre-Tournament antics, and it didn’t even bother with a Training Montage; in contrast, MK21 includes what is best described as a tutorial, not the way you want to go about evoking a video game feel), which is to say 10 minutes better. It also had better effects; its Goro was clumsy and awkward – something like the Cryptkeeper on stereoids – but when Johnny Cage punched him in the balls, I felt it. Conversely, when Cole (Lewis Tan), the aforementioned brand-new character, fights Goro in MK21, it’s like he’s shadowboxing, and his shadow happens to be a four-armed man-mountain of pixels.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, what’s the point of watching a movie where we can anticipate every important event, and anything we don’t see coming a mile away turns out to be unnecessary? For example, it's cool – pun intended – when Sub-Zero makes it hail, but that’s just a gimmick – nothing more than smoke and mirrors.","created_at":"2022-08-28T22:31:57.632Z","id":"630becdd0398ab007d7798f2","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:38:03.811Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630becdd0398ab007d7798f2"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":9},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fight Koreography","key":"lyP9xZatMYQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":true,"published_at":"2021-07-27T17:59:51.000Z","id":"61004c4238e510002f135d25"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mortal Kombat | Full Movie Preview | Warner Bros.

The new film finds Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) and his performers enjoying a run of sod-out shows in his theater.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to settle for success in a regional locale; Buster and crew set off for the big city to produce and perform a show for Bigshot Jimmy Crystal (Bobby Cannavale); who is as ruthless as they come. After conning his way into an audition; Buster claims their new show will feature the return of reclusive Rock Icon Clay Calloway (Bono); who has been a recluse for the past fifteen years.\r\n\r\nJimmy is intrigued and gives Buster a chance and inserts his daughter Porsha (Halsey) into the show despite the fact that while she is a gifted singer; her acting is cringe-worthy.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a madcap tale filled with music and humor as the crew desperately tries to get the show ready and stay away from the very dangerous Jimmy Crystal.\r\n\r\nThe music is very good and the cast is as enjoyable as ever. I would have liked to have seen Seth Mac Farlane return but the performances from Taron Egerton, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, and the ensemble more than deliver.\r\n\r\nFor those who enjoyed the first film and are looking for some fun entertainment for the family; “Sing 2” is a winning performance.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-12-02T16:01:35.405Z","id":"61a8eddf0486380045bbeacc","updated_at":"2021-12-02T16:01:35.405Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61a8eddf0486380045bbeacc"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1348722,"title":"Sing 2","original_title":"Sing 2","plot_overview":"Buster and his new cast now have their sights set on debuting a new show at the Crystal Tower Theater in glamorous Redshore City.

Great actually. Unfortunately this one was quite a disappointing.\r\n\r\nYes, there are a fair number of funny scenes and gags splattered around the movie. The chase sequences in the beginning of the movie are quite hilarious actually.\r\n\r\nThe story however is pretty lame. The original had a decent story. Yes it was a bit outlandish but at least it was a nice family story. This one is nothing of the kind. The basic premise of the story is just silly and the way it is done has pretty much turned it into a education-and-competition-is-bad piece.\r\n\r\nThis father which is one of the main characters are generally behaving like a moron and when, in the middle of the action, he just wanders of like a bloody zombie to watch his daughter instead of pulling the bloody switch that would have saved everything then I lost whatever hope I might have had of liking this movie.\r\n\r\nAlso, after that there was a repeated splattering of woke rubbish about how bad adults are, global warming nonsense and so on and so forth. Sure, those images came from the so called bad guy but any one with common sense knows that they were really there to push the message. I find it really despicable when woke story writers cannot keep their agenda out of children and family movies.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote at the beginning, quite a disappointment.","created_at":"2021-12-28T15:51:11.102Z","id":"61cb326f37b3a9004db2bee7","updated_at":"2021-12-28T15:51:11.102Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61cb326f37b3a9004db2bee7"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}},{"id":1380979,"title":"The Boss Baby 2: Family Business","original_title":"The Boss Baby: Family Business","plot_overview":"The Templeton brothers — Tim and his Boss Baby little bro Ted — have become adults and drifted away from each other.

This, mercifully, never found a home there and so could be watched, half-heartedly, from the comfort of my own living room. The rather uninspiring, self-indulgent characterisations of \"Tess\" (Josephine Langford) and \"Hardin\" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) continue to vacillate from loving to loathing each other for reasons that continued to escape me after the first two films. The narrative reminded me of a visualisation of letters one might have written to a lonely hearts column - each problem being acted out on screen by the pair, before the scenario resets (for good or ill) and off we go again. To be fair, they are both quite easy on the eye, but their frequent, creatively photographed, sex scenes accompanied by some mediocre AOR soundtrack quickly start to wear thin. Perhaps I am just too old for this, but I just found their on/off relationship, their secret keeping about things that couldn't matter a jot to anyone, let alone to those who purport to \"love\" one and other, really boring. The truly stilted dialogue and delivery (especially from HFT, complete with a his unique set of \"letraset\" tattoos) ) contrive to make this a real dirge of a watch. Watch out, there's another one coming too....","created_at":"2022-03-27T11:39:51.409Z","id":"62404d075a991500483be4c1","updated_at":"2022-03-27T11:39:51.409Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62404d075a991500483be4c1"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1618743,"title":"After We Fell","original_title":"After We Fell","plot_overview":"Just as Tessa's life begins to become unglued, nothing is what she thought it would be.

filmmaking, where the camera work and the score are technical highlights in a visually fascinating work.\r\n\r\nHavana Rose Liu contributes tremendously with a superb lead debut as the smart and courageous protagonist. Apart from some characterization details that become irrelevant or accidentally depicted in a strangely positive manner, it's hard to imagine the general public not enjoying such an unpredictable,

Chapter 2’ isn’t as stable or as refined a film as its predecessor, and while it feels lacking by comparison, it’s still far better than most studio horror films. It’s epic, ambitious, crazy, witty and unafraid to go for the heart as well as the throat. As a whole, this adaptation of maybe Stephen King’s greatest work feels singular in the landscape of modern horror cinema: two films built on strong interconnected relationships spread over decades, as sentimental as they are vicious, and executed on the scale of a fantasy epic. They also may be amongst the best adaptations of King’s work, understanding what makes his writing (and this novel in particular) so horrifying and so arresting, the human horror amongst the fantastical. Andy Muschietti aimed big with ‘It’, and even in the moments its reach exceeds its grasp, you’re still so glad it reached so high in the first place.\r\n- Daniel Lammin\r\n\r\nRead Daniel's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-it-chapter-2-the-ambitious-conclusion-to-the-beloved-horror-epic","created_at":"2019-09-04T14:05:06.156Z","id":"5d6fc492e22d28000fb54250","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:26.492Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d6fc492e22d28000fb54250"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSo, Chapter Two is a sequel to It (2017), and my expectations were a bit high. I really enjoyed the latter to the point of considering it one of the year’s best, as well as one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations. Andy Muschietti returning to the director’s chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the Losers (not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors) are two of the main reasons why I was genuinely excited. Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema…\r\n\r\nWell, I got to be honest: I’m disappointed. It’s not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn’t even come close to its predecessor’s heels. I disagree with some headlines I’ve read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There’s barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn’t as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.\r\n\r\nSome say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film’s runtime, especially if it’s over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long. There’s more than enough story to explore, and literally, every single character from the Losers Club has an interesting arc. The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that’s funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain’s (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn’t help the pacing.\r\n\r\nThe first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they’re doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it’s pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy / Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie’s subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn’t have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBeverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan / Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little “kid” who’s scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean / Wyatt Oleff) doesn’t do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017’s movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it’s incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it’s a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn’t have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it’s pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great… \r\n\r\nJames McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsgård had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn’t have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsgård since there’s so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.\r\n\r\nAndy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman’s screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions. \r\n\r\nIn the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn’t as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there’s excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it’s … okay.\r\n\r\nRating: C","created_at":"2019-09-12T17:04:19.099Z","id":"5d7a7a93069f0e10db322bcc","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:26.861Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d7a7a93069f0e10db322bcc"},{"author":"Columbusbuck","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Columbusbuck","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a18c79e03c2ef3b29298900891dbaac.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"It's the love story between Richie and Eddie that makes this movie worth viewing twice.

The 90's version had it moments, but I find some scenes unintentionally funny where it reeked of early Stephen King adaptations. 2017 was surprisingly good and a massive improvement, but laid back on cheap thrills.\r\n\r\n‘IT: Chapter Two’ was a tough act to follow up on after the monster success of the first and with the second chapter being the hardest to adapt. I thought the movie both succeeds and stumbles in parts. Although reflecting back makes it feel more like a parody than a serious horror movie. An epic finale that ended in a over the top fashion - with themes of childhood trauma and the idea of holding on to the past despite growing up with age are sprinkled through out. The loser club are all grown up now and returning home to kill IT.\r\n\r\nWhoever cast the grow up version of the loser club deserves massive praise here, because it’s pitch perfect casting and I could definitely see the child stars growing up to be the adult stars. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, and Isaiah Mustafa were all great in bringing the more dramatic aspects to the film. While Bill Hader and James Ranson bring the comedic aspects, but not to say they weren't dramatic as well, even making me tear up at one point.\r\n\r\nBill Skarsgard was truly amazing as Pennywise. The physicality in his movement has a certain silliness that you would expect to see from a clown, yet predatory with his animal-like attacks with drool running down his mouth and eyes staring in opposite directions despite looking straight at you. I find the dancing clown incredibly terrifying whenever he becomes playful and kind to deceive children.\r\n\r\nAndy Muschietti truly shines as a director when it comes to bizarre imagery and unsettling camera angles, while also capturing some real emotions through the lens. The opening scene at the bridge where a homophobic attack takes place was really brutal and starts the movie off strong - on par with the Georgie meets Pennywise scene in the first movie.\r\n\r\nDespite the run time being nearly three hours long, but I can’t recall ever being bored. It moved at a even pace in my opinion. I guess a few scenes could’ve been cut as most of it is unused footage from the first movie. Although it would be difficult to cut scenes as everything follows up to the next scene and that emotional punch towards the end wouldn’t be earned.\r\n\r\nNow for the issues:\r\n\r\nHenry Bowers was completely pointless in this movie and was only used for jump scars. Same thing with Mike, who through out these movies has nothing to do and the important things he did in the book was given to different characters.\r\n\r\nI didn’t like how Stan’s suicide was handle, because you find out he actually “sacrificed” himself to save the others.\r\n\r\nSome of the humor didn’t always land, especially if it’s right after a tense scene where it kinda deflates the horror. At times I struggled to gasp what the film marker was going for in certain scenes. Is this scene suppose to be scary or funny? Both maybe?\r\n\r\nI wish there was more practical work for the monster scenes instead of CGI, because at times it looked really terrible. The finale battle at the end could’ve been in a video game boss fight.\r\n\r\n* Overall rating: Not as strong as the first, but still enjoyed it. Still, let’s kill this f**king clown.**strong text**","created_at":"2020-01-27T18:04:36.238Z","id":"5e2f26341685da0019e932b9","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:33.457Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5e2f26341685da0019e932b9"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"A step down, but <em>'It Chapter Two'</em> is still a very good film.\r\n\r\nIt is, I will say, overly long, it did bore me a little at the midway point; not in a necessarily negative way, I just wanted more. However, it regains its footing with an entertaining ending. I'm usually not a fan of cast changes in film series, but this does it to good effect. I love the characters, whether it be in this film or the preceding entry.\r\n\r\nJessica Chastain and Bill Hader are great choices to play the older versions of Sophia Lillis and Finn Wolfhard, they are very convincing casts. James McAvoy is also a positive addition, while Bill Skarsgård remains enjoyable as It.\r\n\r\nThe score is, again, strong. I like the plot, even if I do feel like it's stretched out and could've had more freshness added to it. It isn't as creepy as the first film either, but still has a solid amount of uneasiness.","created_at":"2020-12-29T16:53:39.443Z","id":"5feb5f1364f716003e0f6ff8","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:49.389Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5feb5f1364f716003e0f6ff8"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"I watched the two films in a double bill and I really did want to enjoy this as much as I did the first - but boy, could this have been much more of a let down?

The older cast saves this from a total disaster by trying to sail the whole film to safe harbor.\r\n\r\nNot only is it by far the worst movie of the festival, but it's also difficult to find similar competition in 2022.\"\r\n\r\nRating: D-","created_at":"2022-10-23T13:17:45.865Z","id":"63553ef9f8e982007c5d3e51","updated_at":"2022-10-23T13:17:45.914Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/63553ef9f8e982007c5d3e51"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"I was rather nervous about seeing this film. After his lacklustre \"debut\" in \"Don't Worry Darling\" I feared that Harry Styles was just going to turn up, smile, get naked, and that would be that. Well, to be fair, we have quite a bit more here in this engaging drama. David Dawson is also quite effective as art gallery curator \"Patrick\" who takes a bit of a shine to policeman \"Tom\" (Styles) after a cycle incident. The latter shows some interest in art and agrees to be drawn (in full constable's uniform). Nervous, \"Patrick\" gives his visitor some Scotch and well, you can imagine the rest. The thing is, of course, the UK in the 1950s was still pretty homophobic, and their behaviour must be clandestine to say the least. Simultaneously, \"Tom\" is trying to conform with a relationship with, and marriage to, \"Marion\" (Emma Corrin) but gradually she becomes aware that Princess Diana wasn't the only person to have three people in her marriage. Reported, somehow, to the authorities, \"Patrick\" faces ruin and violent imprisonment. This historical story is set within a rather less interesting template of modern day life, with the recently stroke-affected \"Patrick\" (a strong, if largely dialogue-free, effort from Rupert Everett) coming to live with the now going-through-the-motions \"Marion\" (Gina McKee) - whose reading of the invalid man's diaries provides us with the basis for the retrospective - and \"Tom\" (Linus Roache) and this rather downbeat scenario rather robs the film of any jeopardy and also drags the pace down into something akin to the soporific. Styles is not yet a very good actor. His frequent kissing scenes are quite clumsy to watch and he speaks in a sort of clipped manner suggesting the elocution people have got at him, but there is still something natural about his performance here. He gels well with the accomplished theatre actor Dawson, and the increasingly disaffected \"Marion\" is well portrayed by Corrin - all delivering a script that does enough to set the scene. It's a stylish production. Amazon have clearly thrown some money at it and combined with a pleasing score from Steven Price this presents us with a better than expected love story with just enough political sense to alert us to the difficulties faced by gay men as recently as 1957. Styles' participation in this movie is bound to raise the profile of the persecution culture that existed then, and still exists in many nations around the world now - and for that he also ought to be commended. It's a solid film, not a great one - but it is certainly worth a gander.","created_at":"2022-10-25T06:29:35.336Z","id":"6357824fefd3c200907b743c","updated_at":"2022-10-25T06:29:35.396Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6357824fefd3c200907b743c"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}},{"id":1625543,"title":"My

K. Rowling still has a lot to learn.\r\n\r\nBy completely shifting the main focus of the franchise to the love relationship between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald, as well as the exploration of the former's imperfections and the tragic, complex past of his family, it gains an emotionally powerful, genuinely fascinating narrative component. Jude Law and Mads Mikkelsen's superb performances broadly contribute to this.\r\n\r\nToo bad the first half suffers from the constant tweaks to the saga, taking once-important characters through irrelevant side adventures and repairing plot points established in earlier installments, seriously undermining the previous films and negatively affecting the pacing of this one.\r\n\r\nThe boat is no longer sinking, but the damage might be too much to continue sailing...\"\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2022-04-12T23:11:32.502Z","id":"625607240dea6e196137ee56","updated_at":"2022-04-12T23:11:32.502Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/625607240dea6e196137ee56"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":2.0},"content":"It feels like The Secrets of Dumbledore spends more time allowing characters to blather on and adamantly stare out windows over actually delivering worthwhile wizard action, which is essentially what people want to see in films like this.\r\n\r\nFull review: https://boundingintocomics.com/2022/04/18/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-review-a-broken-franchise-filled-with-disjointed-magic/","created_at":"2022-04-21T00:25:16.218Z","id":"6260a46c7776f0009ce410f7","updated_at":"2022-04-21T00:25:16.218Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6260a46c7776f0009ce410f7"},{"author":"r96sk","author_details":{"name":"","username":"r96sk","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96c2e0e4ac98450f9e8e3c0a0a40aad8.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Meh again.\r\n\r\n<em>'Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore'</em> isn't any worse than the two films it follows, which is a minor positive at least. I'd actually put it above 1 but just below 2, though I'm splitting hairs really. I just feel all three are simply missing that little something extra, yet I'm not sure exactly what.\r\n\r\nI also feel the same about the cast as I do for the preceding instalments, with the likes of Eddie Redmayne and Jude Law not doing much for me; though Law is at his best in the role here. I will say, however, that I did mildly enjoy Jessica Williams' performance.\r\n\r\nThe pacing is a tad iffy, if nothing super slow. The ending does feel delayed, I would've personally cut a decent chunk of it to be honest. The dialogue and humour is average, but one scene involving Pickett and Teddy did make me laugh in fairness.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm undoubtedly underwhelmed by these spin-offs/prequels to the great <em>'Harry Potter'</em> franchise.","created_at":"2022-05-12T16:28:56.537Z","id":"627d35c83af92900a5f1c2e3","updated_at":"2022-05-12T16:28:56.537Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/627d35c83af92900a5f1c2e3"},{"author":"citizen226","author_details":{"name":"","username":"citizen226","avatar_path":null,"rating":6.0},"content":"We just want Story.

I guess a positive is Jude Law was okay as Dumbledore and the effects were fine when I could tell what the heck was going on since this was so dimly lit.

Woke Disney’s asshats have been trying to get rid of him since the first Pirates movie so they used a bullshit excuse to get rid of him.\r\n\r\nThen already in the first couple of scenes woke Disney goes full woke to cater for a very small but loudmouthed minority. Totally unnecessary since the vast majority do not care and a lot of said majority are simply fed up by having woke shit crammed into the movies for no justifiable reason whatsoever.\r\n\r\nSo, for me, this movie did get off to a poor start indeed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the rest of the movie had literally nothing in it to remedy this bad start except for a bunch of special effects. I really do not understand what woke Disney thought when the put this franchise killer together.\r\n\r\nThe first movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, in the franchise was a great movie. It was colorful, it was family oriented and it was filled with magic and fantastic beasts. It was fun, it was humorous and it had a bit of adventure in it.\r\n\r\nThis movie is nothing like that. Why they call it Fantastic Beasts I do not understand. They should call it Boring Political Drama in the Potter Universe instead.\r\n\r\nIt is dark, grey and, mostly, boring. It is not really a family movie. A lot of the time not much is happening except people walking, standing or sitting and looking gloomy. There are some outbursts of magic action and these are really the only enjoyable scenes in the movie thanks to the special effects.\r\n\r\nThey even managed to drag the supposedly happy ending epilogue out to become frustratingly boring. Amazing how Disney, who has made so many enjoyable family movies, has transformed into woke Disney spewing out one disaster after another.","created_at":"2022-08-16T09:56:41.816Z","id":"62fb69d9a313b8009c86670b","updated_at":"2022-08-16T09:56:41.893Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62fb69d9a313b8009c86670b"},{"author":"[robbie grawey]","author_details":{"name":"[robbie grawey]","username":"robbiegrawey","avatar_path":"/qB7lELWBr2iNbKu3eYBI2bxzJ7I.jpg","rating":4.0},"content":"Overly long and largely unmemorable.

latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has arrived with “Shang Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings”.\r\n\r\nThe film introduces audiences to Shang Chi (Simu Liu); an easygoing San Francisco resident who spends his time parking cars and hanging out with his friend Katy (Awkwafina) and her family.\r\n\r\nLife is steady if unspectacular until he is accosted on a city bus by a group looking to take a pendant his mother gave him. When Shang Chi shocks Katy and the occupants of the bus with his martial arts abilities; he attempts to find his sister Xialing (Meng’er Zhang); who runs an underground fight club. While Xialing is estranged from her brother; their father Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) has conspired to bring them and their pendants before him.\r\n\r\nTheir father uses the power of sacred devices known as the Ten Rings to rule for over a thousand years and destroys all who would oppose him thanks to their power and the army he has gathered over the centuries.\r\n\r\nWenwu wants to revive their long-dead mother as he is convinced that she is calling to him and he wants to be with her as he was able to be a better man and forsake the power and abilities the rings offered him.\r\n\r\nWhen it is learned that Wenwu plans to go to a mythical realm that their mother came from and free her or burn the place to the ground; Shang Chi must make some hard choices between family and doing what he believes is right.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an action-filled thriller with plenty of mysticism and humor.  The film has a very engaging visual style that combines Asian and Western cinematic styles which results in some very engaging visuals as well as action sequences.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets the film apart from many Super Hero films is that the characters have a solid base to them as they have a complexity to them in regards to their past and their motivations. Their relationships with one another are key to the film as family, honor, and justice are key elements to the film but they are not given lip service but are developed well along with their characters.\r\nWhile the final act may be a bit FX heavy for some; I found it in keeping with the story and the characters and the great Sir Ben Kingsley provides some very welcome comic relief in his return as Trevor.\r\n\r\nAwkwafina is also great as she provides some very laugh-out-loud moments but is not afraid to mix it up when the situation calls for him. Simu Liu was very enjoyable in the lead role as he performed the physical aspects of his character well but added a restrained sensitivity to his character as he is a complicated individual who is conflicted by choices he made in his youth and the ramifications of them now as an adult.\r\n\r\nThere are bonus scenes that set up future adventures well including one that will no doubt have Marvel fans heatedly debating when the film premieres.\r\n\r\nOnce again Marvel has shown why they have had such a sustained success with their films as they have done a great job again of introducing a new character to the Cinematic Universe but also connecting him to their cinematic past and future.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2021-08-23T16:35:16.352Z","id":"6123ce44a80236004580f8de","updated_at":"2021-08-23T16:35:16.352Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6123ce44a80236004580f8de"},{"author":"MSB","author_details":{"name":"MSB","username":"msbreviews","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/shang-chi-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start…\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-","created_at":"2021-09-03T16:53:41.944Z","id":"61325315cede69002a10e72f","updated_at":"2021-09-03T16:53:41.944Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61325315cede69002a10e72f"},{"author":"RADIO1'S MR.

As is usual with marvel property this film is a minefield of links to past and future marvel ventures, but is done in such a way that it truly can be an entry point into the extensive universe without having seen the others.\r\n\r\nThe story develops slowly unwrapping the setting but it also serves to highlight the beautiful cinematic choices Destin Daniel Cretton has made, cinematic shots build to a grand climax with a sufficiently marvel-esque battle between relatable family struggles in unrelatable places and circumstances\r\n\r\nThe end to the fight is satisfyingly predictable and leaves a numbness upon the audience because of the climax's grandeur and its fizzle into the marvel trope of comedic endings.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 Pre and post credit scenes who for the marvel enthusiasts add a great deal of pleasure adn completion to the story and set up the shang-chi subfranchise.\r\n\r\nThis film through all of its achievements feels disjointed and only becomes a cinematic feat  at its climax leaving the audience feeeling as if they could have missed the first 50 minutes and still understood the majority of storyline.\r\n\r\nThis is an great feat of film through its inevitable cinematic, it is extremely enjoyable nevertheless.","created_at":"2021-12-16T06:41:10.529Z","id":"61badf86e72fe800615f2382","updated_at":"2021-12-17T16:10:41.658Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61badf86e72fe800615f2382"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke “critics” on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.\r\n\r\nIt begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.\r\n\r\nThis movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.\r\n\r\nThe story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.\r\n\r\nOverall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn’t fall in the trap of trying to “educate” said audience.","created_at":"2022-01-16T10:00:15.617Z","id":"61e3ecaf6aa8e000427354f0","updated_at":"2022-01-16T10:00:15.617Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61e3ecaf6aa8e000427354f0"},{"author":"DallasBob","author_details":{"name":"","username":"DallasBob","avatar_path":"/q0CeevK9dSVKgU8LIns3qttIBq1.jpg","rating":null},"content":"I'll be straight forward with you; I'm old.  And I have a great pleathora of movie viewing history behind these eyes.  Me being old, I am bitter most times from jealously of lost youth and a firey contempt toward lazy boneheaded braindead youth of today.  But I digress...the review.  \r\n\r\nMy review will be short as are my praises, while my critique shall be terse.  Deal with it.  \r\nThis movie is not bad.  I wouldn't call it a waste of money to see, but on the same turn it's not \"OMG, I have to come see this again with Pauly.\"  \r\n\r\nThe special effects (I'm old. Deal) are pretty good, specially when the hero vists the magical homeland his mother gave up gaurding to be with his father.  The fight scenes, while they make an earnest attempt, are not Jackie Chan or Jet Li smooth but they are done with a compentent hand. (So much for being the first Chinese Superhero)\r\n\r\nThere are only few downsides and those are the inconsistencies only a trained eye might see.  If you follow the action and the movie you can simply dismiss them as \"It's in the script.\"  But if you are like me certain questions born of observation nag at you during and after seeing the movie.  Such as, _\"Is the co-star female sidekick supposed to be his girlfriend or sister?!?\"  \"Why does she walk & sound like an old woman if they are supposed to be the same age???\" \"Why does the woman playing his sister look older than he is, but she's supposed to be a few years younger???\"_  I'm not kidding, the woman (While fit) is very UN-easy on the eyes in the beauty department.  And that's saying something considering how dainty most Chinese women appear.  And my last \"knit-pick\" if you will, is that the studio called the rings, rings.  They are not.  They are bracelets since these are worn on the arms instead of the fingers.  But I believe it was done because it was easier to do the special effects for them. \r\n \r\nThe movie is not bad at all, overall.  Good way to pass the time if you happen to run into it on a channel surf. But like _**Black Panther 1**_, not really considered a must-see.","created_at":"2022-02-16T10:47:08.235Z","id":"620cd62c706e56006a4d8e89","updated_at":"2022-02-16T10:47:08.235Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/620cd62c706e56006a4d8e89"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":6}},{"id":1567837,"title":"Shang-Chi

digital magicians at Pixar have returned with an origin story of one of their most famous characters. “Lightyear” opens with an explanation that Andy from “A Toy Story” was given a toy based on his favorite movie in 1995 and that this is the movie upon which the toy was based.\r\n\r\nWith that explanation out of the way, the film centers on a giant ship deep in space that encounters a planet and awakens Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (Chris Evans) to investigate. Along with a fellow ranger and a recruit, Buzz scopes out the planet only to discover it is hostile and makes a hasty exit from the planet. Unfortunately, in doing so their ship is damaged and they are left stranded on the planet and forced to establish a colony.\r\n\r\nYears later Buzz is about to undergo a test flight based on a new fuel that the colony hopes will replicate their previous source and will allow them to travel at the insane velocities needed to cover millions of light-years.\r\n\r\nThings seem to go as planned until a critical failure and Buzz learns that his four-minute flight actually covered several years on the planet. Undaunted Buzz tries again and again and returns to find his friends aging, having children, and passing away with only his robotic cat Sox (Peter Sohn) to keep him connected to his past and assist him.\r\n\r\nWhile this would make for an interesting enough film it is actually just the setup to the larger story which involves a hostile Robot army and an evil menace named Zurg who threatens Buzz and his hastily assembled team of volunteers to save the day.\r\n\r\nThe film has amazing animation and all the humor and charm that one associates with the best Pixar films and is not above giving the audience an emotional tug here and there along the way as I can remember more than a few Pixar films that caused audiences to tear up.\r\n\r\nSince this is the first of the last three Pixar films to make a cinematic release it would be easy to say that it is a return to form for Disney/Pixar but I would say that is an understatement as the film mixes humor, action, and interesting characters to form a very enjoyable and engaging adventure which is one of the most satisfying Pixar films in recent memory and one every bit worthy of their name.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to see what the future holds for this crew as I would very much like to see Buzz and his crew return for new adventures soon as “Lightyear” is a new Pixar classic that the entire family will love.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5","created_at":"2022-06-13T21:30:44.577Z","id":"62a7ac84a8b2ca0052c6a57b","updated_at":"2022-06-13T21:30:44.577Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62a7ac84a8b2ca0052c6a57b"},{"author":"Chris Sawin","author_details":{"name":"Chris Sawin","username":"ChrisSawin","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg","rating":7.0},"content":"Like _Toy Story 4_, _Lightyear_ is an unnecessary installment to the Toy Story franchise, but is enjoyable nevertheless. Its homage to science fiction makes the animated film feel more like a sci-fi actioner rather than an animated film the majority of the time.

Except for an unnecessary, overly complex twist for the target audience in the third act, Buzz Lightyear and his team take viewers through space on a remarkably immersive audiovisual journey.\r\n\r\nThe voice cast is extraordinary, most notably Chris Evans - born to play captains - and Peter Sohn - non-stop hilarious as the robotic cat Sox, Disney's most popular new toy-to-be.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend to see it in theaters!\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+","created_at":"2022-06-18T17:00:57.040Z","id":"62ae04c9595a5600513f1ab6","updated_at":"2022-06-18T17:00:57.040Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62ae04c9595a5600513f1ab6"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Just like in \"Alien\" (1979) a ship's computer wakes some of the crew mid-trip when it detects an uncharted planet. Space Rangers \"Buzz\", \"Hawthorne\" and a rookie take the ship down for a look, but are soon facing some hungry plants and big bugs. He attempts to escape, but the ship (the \"Turnip\") clips a mountain top and crashes, destroying their power crystal. He determines to find a way to replace it - but each time he tests it out, his off-world moments become 4 years for those left behind, and so his repeated attempts to get them all home safely merely see him stay the same age as his companions grow old, marry, have children - grandchildren, even - then die. It's on return from one of his tests, with a functioning power source designed by his auto-cat \"Sox\" - that he discovers their settlement is being besieged by the robot soldiers of \"Emperor Zurg\" and he, together with his cat and an enthusiastic youth training team must destroy the enemy ship and save the day. Director Angus MacLane did pretty much everything here and though it isn't a bad animation, it could possibly have been doing with a few more objective eyeballs to keep it sharp. The story starts off strongly with some fast-paced dialogue and a bit of fun with the inhabitants of their new home. Quickly, though, it becomes a bit repetitive and starts to drag. Sentimentality creeps in a bit too much and as the plot unfolds, it does become a bit harder to establish just what this film has to do with \"Toy Story\" (1995) for which it is supposed to be a prequel (the plot towards the end reminded me of \"Guardians of the Galaxy II\" from 2017). The conclusion doesn't fit at all - indeed, I wondered if this were merely the first of a few films that might, eventually, explain how \"Buzz\" ended up as the new favourite of \"Andy\". The production is good, but that is no longer anything to shout about with Disney/Pixar - it is what they do. This needed to build more on why we cared about \"Buzz\" in the first place, and it doesn't really manage that. It picks up in the last fifteen minutes as the messages of teamwork and collaboration start to flow through the narrative but is really too long. It is still worth a watch on a big screen to appreciate the colourful visual effects.","created_at":"2022-06-20T07:52:02.706Z","id":"62b0272262e86f0060852039","updated_at":"2022-06-20T07:55:26.862Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62b0272262e86f0060852039"},{"author":"Nathan","author_details":{"name":"Nathan","username":"TitanGusang","avatar_path":"/yHGV91jVzmqpFOtRSHF0avBZmPm.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Lightyear is a lighthearted and fun sci-fi adventure. Let me get this out of the way first and foremost, the visuals in this film are spectacular. The artists who did this deserve a raise because this might be the best looking animated film I have ever scene. I really enjoyed the touch of changing the resolution at a certain point. With that out of the way, I really enjoyed this film, the exploration of a new world was really well done. I liked the time traveling elements that were presented, borrowing some from Interstellar, and it brought some really sad moments that nearly drew a tear from me. The cast of characters were funny and their evolution throughout the story was a joy to watch. I was not super impressed with this movies interpretation of Zurg.

It’s definitely not bad. It fills its runtime with funny characters and engaging conflict, but the story is a bad choice for a kids’ movie. It borrowed Interstellar’s time dilation concept and mixed it with an evil future self plot which felt out of place and left my toddler disengaged. I did enjoy the film, but its themes and script felt like a space adventure written for adults shoved into Pixar animated packaging. Lightyear’s identity crisis distracted some from the overall film, and its story bit off more than it could

SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/eternals-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Eternals boasts evident narrative issues that affect its overall structure and pacing, but Chloé Zhao still manages to deliver a solid MCU installment.\r\n\r\nPacked with outstanding performances from the stellar ensemble cast, Zhao still follows some of Marvel's success formulas, but her unique style brings new attributes to the cinematic universe, such as the distinctly gorgeous cinematography and the profound themes of faith and humanity.\r\n\r\nDespite the exposition-driven screenplay, the admittedly underdeveloped yet inclusive, diverse group of characters hold genuinely compelling relationships. For fans of the mandatory action, the extraordinary entertainment levels are still present, but it's definitely the furthest from the MCU a film has ever been.\r\n\r\nIt's meant to be divisive, but fortunately, I fall on the positive side.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B","created_at":"2021-11-08T15:54:42.887Z","id":"6189484266a7c300436aea29","updated_at":"2021-11-08T15:54:42.887Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6189484266a7c300436aea29"},{"author":"RADIO1'S MR.

We're just like the soldiers down there: pawns to their leaders... BLINDED BY LOYALTY!!! \". \r\n\r\n______________________________________________________ \r\n\r\n**A \" HIGH POINTS \" :** 1- Just to \"Keep Things Fresh\", I'm going to shake it up a bit, & start with the Musical side of things, this time around. Ergo : \" So -{ Completely }- Enchanting, Engrossing, & just downright 'On-Point  was the -entire- soundtrack for \"Eternals\" ; with its -Utterly- captivating blend of Soft Rock, Celestial Choirists, 'Heavenly-Ethereal', Soprano Soloists & even a plain good old-fashioned 'silky smooth guitar-synth-vocal ensemble' from Pink Floyd . . . . . that I simply couldn't help but have the -Nagging- feeling that this goliath movie's veteran Music Director, ( Ramin Djawadi ), took an 'Inspirational' page out of Tom Holkenborg's sheerly -Fantastic- 'Musical Playbook' for 'GVK' ( 2021 ), & just ran with it, in the 'best way possible' \". 2- Visually, the picture is nothing short of -{ MESMERIZING 🌌 }- , comfortably living up to the \"Super\"-high standards set by -{ ALL }- of the past 25 MCU ( Marvel Cinematic Universe ) Creations, starting with the \"Fabulous\" And Indeed, -Groundbreaking- 'Ironman', all those years ago in '08 ( with Ramin -Also- doing the whole score for -that- particular Marvel film, incidentally ! ). The Art Direction, Fight Choreography, Stuntwork, Post-Production Digital Effects -and- the Live 'On-Set' - Physical- Special Effects are -all- 'Par Excellence', & well and -{ Truly }- leave little to be desired.\r\n\r\n3- Eternals's cinematography, entirely -Unsurprisingly- , is for the most part 'Lavish, Pristine, & often just outright Gorgeous' ; as is only be -expected- , I suppose, of a movie shot by the likes of -Veteran- lensman Ben Davis . . . . who clearly worked 'Hand-In-Glove' with its \"Frightfully\" Talented Directress, the one & only Chloé Zhao 🔥. At a 'diminutive' 5 feet 4 inches, the ever 'decorous', some might even say 'demure' \"Miz\" Zhao is fast becoming a veritable 'come-from-behind' \" CINEMATIC POWDER KEG\", in the world of all things Hollywood. When Marvel undertook its -{ \"Massive }- gamble by hiring the -Relatively- unknown ( at -that- point ) filmmaker to direct Eternals in Sept.'18 . . . . little did they know that she would not only go on to direct what was to later become the \"Best Picture\" Oscar Winner 2021 ( \"Nomadland\" - 2020 - Indie ) ; but that she would -Also- take home \"Best Director\" ; with the picture having been nominated in -YET ANOTHER FOUR- categories ; and having gone on to -Win- one more Oscar Award -Still- 👏❗ So in a nutshell, if you saw Nomadland and thoroughly appreciated its wide, expansive, & breathtakingly lovely shots, then Eternals -Is- likely to be immensely gratifying to you in -that- respect, without a question . . . with the latter -Not Only- 'generously' providing many, many -{ S P R A W L I N G L Y }- Beautiful Vistas for the eyes to 'feast' on . . . but -Also- giving you a few Mind Numbingly Stellar SPACE shots, as well. \r\n\r\n**B \" DRAW BACKS \" :** 1- I suppose I would be -Well- advised to say, at this point, 'Right-off-the-bat' , that Eternals is well and truly a -Genuinely- difficult film to fully, well . . . . -{ \" U N P A C K \" }- . . . . what with its myriad \"Revisions\" of not only Earth's natural history, but of that of the -Entire- Cosmos 🤷‍♂️❗, as well ; not to mention some -OUTRIGHT- \"Dichotomies\", -{ And }- a truly 'Massive' -Gaping- Hole in the story, towards the end of said movie. The 'gaff' in question is quite -literally- ...{ \"COLOSSAL\" }... as it pertains to a pointedly \"Spatial\" aspect relating to the Celestial 'Tiamut'-s \"Emergence\" ...( hinted at in multiple -Official- previews for the Eternals )... and occurs within the picture's grand finale. I won't reveal any more details about said mistake, because I'm trying very hard to keep this a -NON- spoiler review, ( and what's more, I am confident that if you pay close enough attention to said finale, you are -Very- unlikely, to miss it ). 2- Also, the 'Deviants', ( a.k.a alien ' Apex Predators 👾 ', one of whom is prominently seen fighting Angelina Jolie's 'Thena' on a beach in the aforementioned trailers ), appear a bit too \"Wire Fram-ey\" ....for lack of a better phrase.... for at least the -Entire- first half of the film. In other words: the WIRE-FRAME look that they embody hurts that whole proverbial 'Suspension-Of-Disbelief' thing . . . . to a small, albeit -{ Significant }- . . . . degree. Other than that, as I'm -Immensely- pleased to report, the film boasts nothing less than a -{ \"Stunning\" }- level of CGI prowess, all the way through. \r\n\r\n**C \" FINAL SUMMARY \" :** This is EASILY Marvel s -{ Most }- \"Thought-Provoking\" movie, Although 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', ( with all of their -Own- varied and multitudinous complexities ), are not necessarily -All- that far behind. The fact is, this veritable cinematic collosus boasts not only -Several- Intensely { HUMAN } moments . . . . but also a level of -Philosophical- , ( and I'm going to be -Very- honest here ), 'straightup', you guessed it, -{ EXISTENTIALIST }- mind fodder, as well . . . which most certainly makes it 'the exception and -Not- the rule', in the world of modern day, massive-scale, 'Contemporary Popular Entertainment'. What's more, the absolute- totality of the -Principal- actresses and actors, bar -NONE- .....( it's a sheer 'Who's Who' ensemble cast of about 13, hence too many to mention here )..... do an undeniably -Wonderful- job bringing these 'super-Exotic' characters to life ( almost ) -directly- out of the late great Jack Kirby's ( Rest In Love ! ) comic-book pages. If I just -Had- to pick the performance that stood out for me though, it would unquestionably be Miz. Chan's ( 'Sersi'-s ) truly august & dignified, um, \" Gemma 💎 👏❗Of A Performance\" ( sorry peeps, -Just- couldn't resist that one ! ) . . . on account of the Deeply Beautiful \"HUMANITY-AND-EMPATHY\" that she so effortlessly appears to bring to her -Leader's- role, in Eternals. **Thus, it's going to be : A \" Solid, Whole Hearted . . . .

Let’s face it: unless we are very intelligent or very beautiful, if a Marvel film actually came to life around us, our roles would be as helpless victims either saved or killed as collateral damage. So we are talking vicarious involvement here. The only Marvel film I would keep watching any time it comes on is Ant Man and the Wasp, as I find its wit and humor irresistible.\r\n\r\nAs I watched Eternals, I absorbed what I felt were a couple of plot holes large enough for an eternal to fly through. And I am not talking about the science; I give a lot of leeway to scence fiction and similar genres in order to serve the plot. I mean, they went to the trouble of explaining why the Eternals weren’t around to help out with our boy Thanos, but considering the origin story of the Eternals, I did wonder why there didn’t all have every superpower rather than one each.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I will not do a deep dive into how this entry serves the overarching Marvel story arc, because I am not a Marvel fan, per se. (After all, I was a DC comic reader as a young lad!) Suffice to say Eternals did not insult my intelligence as a movie viewer but rather, as mentioned at the outset, it held me all the way through it.","created_at":"2022-01-22T07:51:08.728Z","id":"61ebb76c848eb900f038cb4a","updated_at":"2022-06-23T12:29:02.040Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61ebb76c848eb900f038cb4a"},{"author":"James Sprag","author_details":{"name":"James Sprag","username":"JamesSprag","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/382bd490c9e37f4d2f2693990605ec78.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"When I started watching this picture, I did not expect anything supernatural or something new, and as usual with films from the Marvel film studio, it turned out to be right.\r\n\r\nthe authors of the script decided not to break the tradition and, as usual, took the path of least resistance, there are heroes, there are villains, they are fighting each other for the fate of all mankind. The plot revolves around the fact that a certain deity sends detachments of superheroes endowed with superpowers to protect intelligent life on different planets from evil predatory creatures remotely resembling ancient lizards, which they almost successfully cope with, but it turns out that the main characters fought absolutely the wrong evil and the main battle they are ahead. The first hour of the film is mostly banal chatter and shots telling about previous events, but towards the end there is an increase in the intensity of events up to an epic massacre of good and evil. The plot does not carry a global mystery and everything is clear from the very beginning, and small plot twists are guessed even before the viewer sees them. And judging by the finale, the audience will be fed one more, and maybe several films on the topic.","created_at":"2022-01-22T19:57:09.379Z","id":"61ec6195ce5d82006a61c690","updated_at":"2022-02-02T14:12:39.902Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61ec6195ce5d82006a61c690"},{"author":"KlassicFilms","author_details":{"name":"","username":"KlassicFilms","avatar_path":"/uZFcTL8Eggr4pB8SiTExNSJs4xV.jpg","rating":2.0},"content":"As Simon Cowell would say:\r\n\r\nThat was the worst we've seen all day\"","created_at":"2022-01-28T15:51:23.840Z","id":"61f410fbcedac40ec032bfe0","updated_at":"2022-02-02T14:08:54.952Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/61f410fbcedac40ec032bfe0"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"The premiss here is quite fun - 7,000 years ago a diverse race of immortals arrive on Earth to protect the population from a monstrous race of \"Deviants\" who are bent on eating us all up. Their \"Prime Directive\", if you will, is that they must not interfere in human conflict, so once they have cleared away the beasties, they split up and lead separate lives. That is, until \"Sersi\" (Gemma Chan), her pal \"Sprite\" (Lia McHugh) and her beau \"Dane\" (Kit Harrington) are set upon in London by a newly empowered creature only to be rescued by \"Ikaris\" (Richard Madden) - and that incident forces them all to reassemble. Pretty soon they discover the body of their erstwhile leader \"Ajak\" (Selma Hayek) and must now combine their forces to thwart their ever strengthening enemy and learn why they have resurfaced. Unfortunately, what now follows is a stunning looking, but really pretty dull series of set-piece scenarios that rather clunkily combine mythology and melodrama, romance and action. The camera loves Madden, but as an actor - even clad in blue leather - he is little better than a handsome man. Kumail Nanjiani (\"KIngo\") has a soupçon of charisma, but the rest of the cast including the really out of place Angelina Jolie (\"Thena\") and Harish Patel (\"Karun\") who is intent on videoing everthing at considerable risk to himself, really offer little by way of characterisation and the attempts at humour misfire most of the time. The story has some great effects, but so what? That's what we expect from the most mediocre of productions nowadays. What was needed here were far fewer actors and a much more robust story - and, yes, it could probably have lost the half an hour spent justifying the enormous budget in far-lung locations (real and imaginary). There's a final scene midway through the credits that really does not bode well for the sequel either. I was really pretty bored with this film and though undoubtedly a colourful, action-packed big screen experience, it is an entirely forgettable film to watch.","created_at":"2022-03-28T10:18:48.057Z","id":"62418b887caa47004761b99c","updated_at":"2022-03-28T10:18:48.057Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62418b887caa47004761b99c"},{"author":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","author_details":{"name":"Per Gunnar Jonsson","username":"Dark Jedi","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbabaea0fa98692d00130498d7ac5d7c.jpg","rating":null},"content":"Although it was nice to watch a Marvel movie which is not just a rehash of the same old universe and which was reasonably woke-free for once this movie was unfortunately pretty meh. It is not as bad as many of the detractors claim but it is miles away from being as good as some of those who liked it claims. It is actually pretty meh.\r\n\r\nOn the good side there are some decent special effects but that is more or less to be expected. It is the one thing that Marvel movies usually have going for them after all.\r\n\r\nIt is a fairly serious movie that is not so polluted with comic relief as some of the Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nThe story is a interesting one but it is unfortunately a bit wasted by the implementation in this movie. Also, it pretty much screws up evolution from the extinction of the dinosaurs as well as any form of religious theories (not that I am a great believer in those though). But then this is pure superhero fantasy so I’m not too bothered by that.\r\n\r\nMy main gripe with this movie is that it, as is way to often the case with Hollywood, portrays the Eternals more like a bunch of bickering dysfunctional children than the wise thousands of years old beings that they are supposed to be.\r\n\r\nIkarus in particular is a pure Hollywood asshat. He reminds me of that pervert asshole Homelander in the depraved Hollywood creation The Boys. However Druig and Sprite also grated on me in a lot of the scenes. I never like characters that betray people, stick knifes in peoples backs (literally) and so on.\r\n\r\nThe movie also felt a bit slow. There was a lot of rather boring filler material between the actual action or advancement of the story, and a shitload of flashbacks. I hate flashbacks but then that is probably personal. To me they just interrupt the flow.\r\n\r\nThe movie also does not really feel very positive. It ends rather sadly actually. Also, at the end they may have saved Earth but, if the story is to believed, by doing so they prevented billions and billions of beings from ever being created. Not really a win-win is it?\r\n\r\nIt is clear that this movie was setting things up for a continuation and, despite my reservations about this one, I think there is a pretty good oportunity to create something decent from this. It all depends on whether they pick a decent write/director or one of the woke Marvel hacks.","created_at":"2022-04-19T09:26:14.540Z","id":"625e803619690c00a7606cdd","updated_at":"2022-04-19T09:26:14.540Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/625e803619690c00a7606cdd"},{"author":"JPRetana","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPRetana","avatar_path":"/eYudFTVvIpCweDVQEl878whalTy.jpg","rating":1.0},"content":"The Eternals have lived on Earth for 7,000 years. That’s a long time, but their movie somehow manages to feel even longer than that. Now, if the Eternals predate the Avengers by a few millennia, and have been actively and openly involved in various periods of human history, where where they during the events of the last two Avengers movies?\r\n\r\nSince those (mis)adventures had nothing to do with “Deviants”, the Eternals presumably couldn't be bothered to lift a finger. If that’s the case, why did they stay on Earth so long after the Deviants had supposedly been eradicated?\r\n\r\nAnd if the Deviants are at least as old as the Eternals, why are they called after a word in a language that wasn't going to exist until eons later? This question actually has an answer, albeit a nonsensical one: as far as I can discern English is, for some unfathomable reason, the lingua franca of the Universe, which of course includes both the Earth and Olympia.\r\n\r\nOne Eternal even communicates with sign language, which I guess means she invented it. Moreover, several Eternals have an unambiguous ethnicity; are we to understand that they originated these, for lack of a better term, races on our planet?\r\n\r\nOr is it just a big coincidence that Olympia has Mexicans, Irish, Scottish, Pakistanis, and South Koreans? And speaking of inventions, it seems that ancient civilizations were more (or less, as the case may be) technologically advanced than we had previously thought; specifically when it comes to the CGI that they apparently used to build their cities.\r\n\r\nThis imagery that looks straight out of Age of Empires is the reason that Eternals never generates the slightest sense of urgency (and if it did, it could never keep it up for the more than two and a half hours of running time).\r\n\r\nWho cares about the destruction of the world when the world in the first place is plainly phonier than a diploma issued by Megatrend University? Hell, the entire Universe seems to consist almost exclusively of green screens.\r\n\r\nHow much respect or fear can Arishem and the Deviants respectively inspire or instill when they are nothing more than shapeless masses of pixels? All things considered, the only redeeming thing about this film is that it points out (unwittingly, I must assume) the arbitrariness of everything that has to do with the MCU: \"Five years ago, Thanos wiped out half the population of the universe ... But the people of this planet brought them all back with a snap of the fingers.\" Now imagine a 7,000-year long finger-snap.","created_at":"2022-08-28T16:53:22.636Z","id":"630b9d820398ab007d778898","updated_at":"2022-09-03T15:34:33.830Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/630b9d820398ab007d778898"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":9}},{"id":1490260,"title":"Eternals","original_title":"Eternals","plot_overview":"The Eternals are a team of ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years.

Just how this young girl from eastern Europe managed to get herself placed in a wealthy American family without any semblance of blood or DNA checks to establish - for real - that she was who the father \"John\" (Peter Sarsgaard) desperately wanted her to be. Though I did enjoy the film thereafter, that implausibility was never far from the back of my mind as we see the monster that is \"Esther\" (a strong performance from Isabelle Fuhrman) develop around us causing havoc and mayhem for the \"Coleman\" family - recently recovering from their own tragic bereavement. The concept is fascinating - an adult (and a ruthless and unstable one at that) in the persona of a child using innocence as the ultimate tool for deception is cleverly delivered by the cast and from the pen of Alex Mace. The wintry scenario and the John Ottman score also contribute well to a genuine sense of menace as those who get in her way are unceremoniously snuffed out. She even manages to ensnare the services of a young and vulnerable accomplice, too! It's a perfect example of hiding in plain sight, and is certainly one of the more effective role-playing, psychological, horror films I have seen.","created_at":"2022-11-04T11:23:03.785Z","id":"6364f617d7107e008d77363a","updated_at":"2022-11-04T11:23:03.866Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6364f617d7107e008d77363a"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]}},{"id":1289426,"title":"Orphan","original_title":"Orphan","plot_overview":"After

To be fair, also, he is not afraid of spending a great deal of time in the make up chair, as we saw in \"House of Gucci\" (2021) and frequently see here. Sadly, though, after my appreciation of Jared's eye candiness wore off, what I was left with was Luke Evans' \"Dracula Untold\" (2014) just without Charles Dance, and a hint of \"Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (from 1931). The imagery is fine, the film looks super - but so what. Marvel/Columbia should be doing that anyway. It's the story. It's so thin. Matt Smith is lightweight at the best of times, and together with Adria Arjona's really unremarkable contribution as Leto's sidekick \"Dr.Bancroft\" and some sparing interventions from the other Jared in this film (Harris) this all just lollops along as if it were just the money-no-object pilot episode of a drama series that will struggle to get a commission. I love the genre, but the words barrel, bottom and scraped came to mind pretty early on. Sadly the handsome Mr. Leto reminds me of Eric Bana - very easy on the eye but not good enough to carry a film.","created_at":"2022-04-04T09:29:44.426Z","id":"624aba88d9f4a6004f5911f1","updated_at":"2022-04-04T09:29:44.426Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/624aba88d9f4a6004f5911f1"},{"author":"Leno","author_details":{"name":"Leno","username":"fLeno","avatar_path":"/vNPHnw6jgbERZmhNlDk3OwL9KgH.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"**Not a disaster as others seem to imply but definitely disappointing for a movie of such high budget.**\r\n\r\nMorbius is a kind of a vampire Batman-Frankenstein mix. In the search of the cure for a rare and highly-debilitating blood decease, Morbius (a genius doctor) find a cure that has a terrible cost. His sickness is pretty much gone and he attains super powers, but also feel an insatiable lust for blood that can't be fully satiated by artificial blood. \r\n\r\nThe movie revolves around Morbius trying to remedy the consequences of the evil he unleashed to the world. While the cinematography is pretty decent, the plot really sucks. In the end of the movie, there are too many open questions (and inconsistencies) in the plot. \r\n\r\nThe movie seems to end very abruptly without any decent climax, and many of the secondary characters that I expected would play an important role in the resolution of the conflicts, seem to have been completely forgotten.

Admittedly I have nothing that I like either, but it's a forgettably fine film. In fact, I found it to be the quickest viewing experience of the year so far - the run time absolutely flew by for me.\r\n\r\nThe cast are a bit up-and-down. Jared Leto has a few moments and overall I'm OK with him in the lead role, meanwhile Matt Smith is more miss than hit but again didn't annoy me or anything like that. Elsewhere, it was pleasant to see Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson in smaller roles.\r\n\r\nThe special effects, for the most part, are serviceable in my eyes. I think I also heard that people were questioning why the filmmakers didn't opt for prosthetics and went full blown CG for the faces - I found everything in that area to be fine, it would've been cooler if they mixed it up but if I hadn't heard anything about it I honestly would not have even noted it.\r\n\r\nThere are some lame lines of dialogue, namely that hunger one, and the credit scenes don't leave any excitement or intrigue behind. Aside from that, I genuinely didn't dislike this. A quintessential 6/10 flick, for me. It is the weakest of the first three <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony%27s_Spider-Man_Universe#Films\" rel=\"nofollow\">SSU</a> films, granted.","created_at":"2022-04-19T13:05:24.698Z","id":"625eb3948ac3d01602f89024","updated_at":"2022-04-19T13:06:51.060Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/625eb3948ac3d01602f89024"},{"author":"5rJoud","author_details":{"name":"","username":"5rJoud","avatar_path":"/n8qpHMvhs5b751PUzxmFUzHA4U3.jpg","rating":1.0},"content":"Nothing in this movie makes any sense. If he has to drink a bag of blood every 6 hours, why not just do so? The human populace of how many billion people can not sustain a single vampire? No, he makes and consumes artificial blood for ethical reasons. Who says he needs to kill or hurt people to get what he needs? Horrible premise for his actions, not believable at all. And the rest of the story is the same. Weird decision making, boring, pointless dialogue. The bad guy is suddenly bad lacking any morals because he was bullied once apparently. Vampire powers are a myriad of random things. One time he is able to fly and it is hard to determine why exactly, the movie suggests because a subway train is pushing the air in front of it. Not only is it nonsense, it also looks bad CGI wise. To end on a good note, Jared Leto is a great actor and I would love to finally see him in a good movie.","created_at":"2022-05-16T14:01:13.135Z","id":"62825929cee481544b14fc4d","updated_at":"2022-05-16T14:01:13.135Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62825929cee481544b14fc4d"},{"author":"CrisisDog","author_details":{"name":"","username":"CrisisDog","avatar_path":null,"rating":8.0},"content":"Honestly, I don't know why this movie has gotten so many bad ratings.  Yes, it's a vampire movie, and I'm not sure how much originality can be squeezed out of that genre anymore.  I am totally -not- a Jared Leto fan from some of his other movies and was hesitant on that behalf to watch this film. But once in, he actually pulls off a very realistic doctor role that is also bitter on life due to his health.  Of course, looking for the solution leads to the bigger story that you could probably guess by now.  I'm also at a point where I'm \"over it\" with a lot of these superhero movies, so it was refreshing to see something different out of the MCU.  If I did have any complaints, there are some unanswered questions at the end, but you know, that always leaves room for a sequel.  However, on top of that, the two end credit scenes just add more \"Huuuh?\" and probably do more damage than good.\r\n\r\nNot the best movie ever, but a far reach from the worst as well.

A bit surprised since it is a new Marvel movie after all. It is even free of woke bull manure which made me even more surprised.\r\n\r\nThe “scientific” part of Morbius changing his DNA, overnight no less, by means of some serum that he derived from vampire bats is of course utter nonsense but one cannot really complain too much about that since it is straight from the original comic book character.\r\n\r\nThe story is really simple and not much to write home about but it works in its simplicity. After all, in this kind of movie we really do not need something fancy as long as it is not downright stupid. It only needs to be a vehicle for the action and special effects and for that purpose the story works fine.\r\n\r\nI like Morbius. He is intelligent and he doesn’t just sink down in some self pity or whining sessions when he finds out that things did not go exactly as planned. Sure, he is not happy about it but at least he does research into his condition and he actually takes the effort to learn what he can do with his new powers.\r\n\r\nI also do like the special effects and the action in general. The bad guy was rather predictable and not really very charismatic but he worked fairly okay. I think that most of the actors made a good enough job actually.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about anything it was that scene in the beginning where they claimed that vampire bats could “finish off” big animals in minutes or something. That not what vampire bats do or how they feed. It is of course utter ignorant bull manure by some idiot script writer and it was really totally unnecessary to soil the movie with such nonsense already in the first scenes. I had hoped that ignorant script writers like that died out together with the last flying rubber Piranha in the early 80’s.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I quite liked the movie. A lot of movies that I’ve watched lately have felt bloated and too long for the material. This one I actually felt was too short.","created_at":"2022-08-16T18:27:15.106Z","id":"62fbe1835f6c49007a659f73","updated_at":"2022-08-16T18:27:15.204Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62fbe1835f6c49007a659f73"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/blEC280vq31MVaDcsWBXuGOsYnB.jpg","rating":5.0},"content":"**Sadly a run-of-the-mill superhero origin movie with nothing special to make me care.**\r\n\r\nNot as bad as everyone is saying, but it missed its opportunity by about 20 years.
